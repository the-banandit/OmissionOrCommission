      "Republicans Rick Santorum and Ron Paul looked beyond Saturday's presidential caucuses in Nevada, eyeing contests further down the nominating calendar and signaling the results were unlikely to change their strategy in a race that seemed to have become a two-man contest between Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich.\n",
      "Santorum told Republicans on the Western Slope that Colorado was \"a wide-open state\" and urged voters to support him in Tuesday's upcoming contest. Paul, meanwhile, kept a watchful eye on Colorado even as he campaigned in Minnesota, another state that meets Tuesday for the latest round of GOP contests that seem to shuffle the race on a regular basis.\n",
      "\"This isn't a state where someone has a natural advantage,\" Santorum said in Montrose, before flying on to events in Loveland and Greeley. \"No one can stake a claim and say, `He's going to win this state.' This is a wide-open race and you have an opportunity to reset this race.\"\n",
      "Santorum, declared the winner of Iowa's leadoff caucuses last month but likely to face a fourth consecutive loss Saturday in Nevada, planned to head to Minnesota for a busy day on Sunday.\n",
      "Paul, too, was campaigning in Minnesota. Speaking before a few hundred people at a Rochester high school, Paul said his economic ideas are penetrating and a strong showing in Minnesota and other upcoming states will send a strong signal that Americans are fed up with tepid change and government as it is.\n",
      "\"The one thing that is on our side is the American people are waking up,\" he said in a speech frequently interrupted by applause and standing ovations.\n",
      "Yet Paul was keeping close tabs on Nevada, where he placed second in 2008 behind Romney.\n",
      "The Texas congressman is hoping for an outright win this time. Advisers believe the state's independent, live-and-let-live ethos is receptive to Paul's libertarian message and that his band of diehard supporters can be counted on to show up at the caucuses.\n",
      "Paul's campaign has spent $350,000 on television ads in Nevada, just behind Romney who's spent $371,000, according to the Smart Media Group which tracks political advertising. Newt Gingrich's campaign did not advertise at all on television in Nevada and Santorum placed only a $12,000 cable buy.\n",
      "Santorum has vowed to continue his race until the Republicans meet in Tampa for their nominating contest, and Paul has shown no interest in shutting down his libertarian-leaning campaign that still draws enthusiastic crowds of fervent supporters.\n",
      "Romney and Gingrich, meanwhile, were fighting in Nevada for the first contest in the West. The tone of the campaign had turned caustic in recent days, all the while Santorum built giant crowds.\n",
      "He spent Friday in Missouri, which has also has a primary Tuesday that lacks Gingrich's name on the ballot and does not award delegates.\n",
      "Santorum also sought to undercut Romney's argument he is most electable because he has the most money and strongest organization. Santorum, who raised $1 million online in recent days, said no one will be able to go tit-for-tat with President Barack Obama.\n",
      "\"Folks, he's not going to have the most money in the general election. Barack Obama's going to have more money. .... (Romney) is going to be outspent badly. Any Republican will be,\" he said.\n",
      "Santorum also said Gingrich's speaking skills -- \"Newt can throw out some funny lines,\" Santorum conceded -- alone wouldn't be enough to go up against Obama's re-election.\n",
      "\"If you're a swing voter, who are you going to believe?\" Santorum said. \"America is not looking for well-oiled weather vanes. They are looking for leaders.\"\n",

      "Upon hearing the news of Whitney Houston's death yesterday, I was deeply saddened. In my opinion, Houston was the greatest singer who ever lived, and I, like many others, want to take a moment to mourn the loss of such an incredible musical talent.\n",
      "While the cause of her death is still unknown, TMZ reported Sunday that prescription drugs were found in the Beverly Hills Hilton hotel room where Houston was found. TMZ also reported that family members said that Houston had been taking the drug Xanax.\n",
      "Xanax is a psychoactive drug used to treat anxiety and other pain disorders. It works by binding to receptors in the brain in order to slow down chemicals that may have become unbalanced. This ultimately relieves tension and eventually reduces symptoms that result from various anxiety disorders.\n",
      "Xanax is a prescription drug, so unless these pills were obtained illegally, Houston must have had them prescribed by a physician. If that's the case, I'm sick and tired of these physicians not really understanding that folks who have had a drinking problem are extremely vulnerable to the side effects of mixing Xanax with alcohol. Alcohol incredibly increases the power and the central nervous system effects of many benzodiazepines, Xanax being one of them.\n",
      "It is well known that Houston had a history of substance abuse. She had herself said that she was once addicted to cocaine, and even the night before her death, she was allegedly seen drinking very late into the night. When a patient asks me for drugs to deal with emotional issues, I always have to be aware of what those underlying emotional issues are, as well as previous health conditions. It does not make any sense to me when folks who have a history of drug dependency are not properly monitored before giving them drugs that alter their moods.\n",
      "Sometimes people who take these drugs don't realize that their medications could have potentially dangerous side effects when taken in combination with other substances and could make them impaired. This could potentially lead to accidents happening. I know it was reported by TMZ that Houston was found in the bath tub of her hotel room, so it makes perfect sense to me that perhaps side effects from these prescription pills made her unconscious and may have led her to drown.\n",
      "I know that the autopsy report is still pending along with the toxicology reports, but if these prescription pills were indeed a contributing factor in Houston's death, I want to know if any physicians were involved in prescribing these drugs to her. It might just be that their irresponsibility contributed to the death of one of the greatest American voices to have ever topped the charts.\n",

      "Senators from both sides of the aisle are warning that looming EPA regulations on gasoline could impose billions of dollars in additional costs on the industry and end up adding up to 25 cents to every gallon of gas.\n",
      "The senators, in a letter this week to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, urged the agency to back off the yet-to-be-released regulations. Though the EPA has not yet issued any proposal, they claimed the agency is planning to call for a new requirement to reduce the sulfur content in gasoline.\n",
      "Citing the nearly $3.40-a-gallon average price of gas and the state of the economy, the senators said \"now is not the time for new regulations that will raise the price of fuel even further.\"\n",
      "They said it would be \"expensive\" for companies to meet the sulfur targets and cited a study that found it could add up to $17 billion in industry-wide, up-front expenses, in addition to another $13 billion in annual operating costs.\n",
      "This could in turn add between 12 and 25 cents to an average gallon of gasoline \"depending on the stringency of the proposed rule,\" they wrote.\n",
      "\"If the EPA does not proceed carefully with its regulations, the nationwide price of fuel could increase to the further detriment of consumers and businesses,\" the senators warned.\n",
      "The lawmakers on the letter were: Sens. James Inhofe, R-Okla.; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; John Barrasso, R-Wyo.; Mary Landrieu, D-La.; David Vitter, R-La.; and Mark Begich, D-Alaska.\n",
      "The EPA did not comment on the senators' complaints.\n",
      "Asked Friday for a response to the concerns, the EPA said: \"EPA is still in the process of developing the proposal.\"\n",
      "An EPA official said publicly in November that the agency was developing the so-called \"Tier 3\" standards proposal during a House subcommittee hearing.\n",
      "Margo Oge, director of the EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality, told lawmakers that the proposal would help the country meet its \"clean air goals.\"\n",
      "\"Motor vehicles and their fuel are an important source of compounds that form air pollution,\" she said.\n",
      "Oge said reducing sulfur in gasoline would make emission control technology more effective, and \"the end result would be cleaner air.\"\n",
      "If the EPA formally issues the proposal, it would probably take more than a year for the agency to review public comments and finalize any plan.\n",
      "A Senate Republican aide said the authority to tighten the sulfur standards comes from the Clean Air Act but noted that EPA has the discretion to either impose the standards or not.\n",
      "The current sulfur standard is 30 parts per million in gasoline -- that's down from a prior standard of 300 parts per million. The new proposal could bring the standard down to 10 parts per million, according to the senators who wrote to Jackson\n",
      "The aide said there was a \"bigger benefit\" when the standard dropped from 300 to 30 parts per million. But squeezing that down to 10 parts per million, the aide said, might not offer as much bang for the buck.\n",
      "\"They're extraordinarily expensive relative to the last round of sulfur reductions,\" the aide told FoxNews.com.\n",

      "A defiant President Barack Obama, tired of Senate Republicans stalling his nominee to lead a new consumer protection agency, put him in charge Wednesday over their opposition.\n",
      "\"I refuse to take `no' for an answer,\" the president said.\n",
      "Outraged GOP leaders in Congress immediately suggested that courts would determine whether Richard Cordray's appointment was illegal.\n",
      "With a director in place, Obama said the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can start overseeing the mortgage companies, payday lenders, debt collectors and other financial operations often blamed for practices that helped undermine the economy.\n",
      "Obama announced the move with Cordray by his side before a cheering crowd in Ohio, a politically vital state where Cordray once was attorney general.\n",
      "\"Every day that we waited was another day when millions of Americans are left unprotected,\" Obama.\n",
      "Until Cordray took over, the office didn't have all the tools needed \"to protect consumers against dishonest mortgage brokers or payday lenders, and debt collectors who are taking advantage of consumers,\" Obama said. \"And that's inexcusable. It's wrong.\"\n",
      "In political terms, the recess appointment during the congressional break raised the level of confrontation for a president seeking re-election by championing the middle class and challenging an unpopular Congress. Acting right after Tuesday's GOP presidential caucuses in Iowa, Obama sought to grab attention and show he would not be slowed, making his most brazen leap-frog over Congress.\n",
      "Senate Republicans had halted Cordray's nomination because they think the consumer agency is too powerful and unaccountable.\n",
      "The Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, accused Obama of an unprecedented power grab that \"arrogantly circumvented the American people.\"\n",
      "Added House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio: \"It's clear the president would rather trample our system of separation of powers than work with Republicans to move the country forward. This action goes beyond the president's authority, and I expect the courts will find the appointment to be illegitimate.\"\n",
      "It was unclear who might undertake a legal fight. But people familiar with the matter said an outside private group regulated by the consumer agency might be in the best legal position.\n",
      "By going around the Senate, where Democrats hold an edge but Republicans can block action, Obama essentially declared that the chamber's short off-and-on sessions are a sham intended to block him, but don't prevent him from such an appointment.\n",
      "Yet it was his own party that started the practice when Republican George W. Bush was president.\n",
      "In reality, Obama had little choice to get the consumer agency fully running after months of stalemate.\n",
      "White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer announced Obama's move on Twitter after senior administration officials first confirmed it to The Associated Press. Obama spokesman Jay Carney said White House lawyers have determined Obama is within his bounds to appoint Cordray now.\n",
      "Cordray, who's expected to take over this week, stands to serve for at least the next two years, covering the length of the Senate's session.\n",
      "At a high school in the Cleveland suburb of Shaker Heights, Obama said Republicans were only blocking Cordray because they wanted to water down consumer protections.\n",
      "\"I'm not going to stand by while a minority in the Senate puts party ideology ahead of the people we were elected to serve,\" he said.\n",
      "More than a standoff over one significant appointment, the fight speaks to the heart of a presidential campaign under way. Presiding over a troubled but improving economy, Obama's must persuade a weary middle class that he is their advocate, while fending off criticism from Republicans challengers and lawmakers.\n",
      "Obama has constitutional power to make appointments during a congressional recess.\n",
      "Expressly to keep that from happening, Republicans in the Senate have had the Senate running in \"pro forma\" sessions, meaning open for business in name with no actual business planned. Democrats started the practice under Bush to halt him from making recess appointments.\n",
      "The Senate held such a session on Tuesday and planned another one on Friday. Republicans contend Obama cannot make a recess appointment during such a break of less than three days, based on years of precedent, and they point to comments by Obama's own Justice Department echoing that view.\n",
      "Regardless, the Obama White House now contends such an approach is a gimmick.\n",
      "For all practical purposes, the Senate is in recess and Obama is free to make the appointment on his own, without Senate confirmation, administration officials said.\n",
      "McConnell shot back that Obama's move \"lands this appointee in uncertain legal territory, threatens the confirmation process and fundamentally endangers the Congress' role in providing a check on the excesses of the executive branch.\"\n",
      "The president also was expected to announce other recess appointments, possibly including nominees to the National Labor Relations Board.\n",
      "Republicans have had little opposition if any to the qualifications of Cordray. Their objection is with the consumer agency itself.\n",
      "Obama and his team say lawmakers should try to revise the Wall Street oversight law if they don't like it, not keep the agency from performing its job.\n",
      "Before his remarks Wednesday, Obama met with a family that got taken advantage of by a mortgage broker. He wanted to use their story as an example of how the consumer agency can crack down on such practices.\n",
      "Obama was focusing on the most Democratic congressional district in Ohio, a Cleveland suburb, a day after Mitt Romney won Iowa's Republican presidential caucuses by just eight votes. Obama's trip signals the White House's intent to keep the president in the public eye even as the political world focuses on the GOP's selection process.\n",

      "Some people seem to survive cold and flu season with nary a sniffle.\n",
      "And yet plenty others seem to catch cold after cold; sidelined with a perpetually stuffed-up nose and hacking cough that lasts all winter long. So what's different between these two groups? Research shows your cold and flu vulnerability may come down to a few important—and unexpected—habits, like how much sugar you eat or how dry your nose is.\n",
      "Assess your risk with these seven signs of impaired immunity, and learn what you can do to stay healthy.\n",
      "1. You have a sweet tooth.\n",
      "Eating too much sugar doesn't just pack on pounds …\n",
      "A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that eating 100 g of sugar (think three cans of soda) significantly hampered the ability of white blood cells to kill bacteria for up to 5 hours afterward.\n",
      "Eat These Immune Boosting Foods Instead\n",
      "2. You don't drink enough water.\n",
      "There's a reason moms and doctors always push fluids on you when you're sick.\n",
      "Your body needs plenty of water to flush out toxins—and yes, coffee and tea are acceptable sources. How much fluid you should drink daily varies from person to person. You're drinking the right amount if your urine is pale yellow.\n",
      "3. You've got a lot of weight to lose.\n",
      "You know excess weight is unhealthy for your heart, brain and other organs. But it's also bad for your immune system.\n",
      "In fact, those who become most seriously ill with swine flu tend to share the same characteristic: a body mass index over 40, meaning they are morbidly obese. Excess weight can cause hormonal imbalances and inflammation that impairs the immune system's ability to fight infection.\n",
      "Lose 35+ Pounds Without Working Out\n",
      "4. You drink water from a well.\n",
      "Surprisingly, the cleanliness of your drinking water can play a role in whether or not you get sick.\n",
      "As many as 25 million Americans drink well water that contains more than the safe levels of arsenic determined by the EPA. Arsenic has been linked to several different cancers, and affects the immune response to swine flu as well. When researchers from Dartmouth Medical School inoculated two groups of mice with the H1N1 virus, the group that had spent 5 weeks drinking arsenic-tainted water developed suppressed immune systems, and many died. The mice that didn't drink the water got the flu but recovered completely.\n",
      "If your well water tests high, consider switching to bottled water or investing in a remediation system that will remove the arsenic.\n",
      "5. Your nose is Sahara desert-dry.\n",
      "As uncomfortable as it may be, a runny nose is actually a good defense against colds and the flu.\n",
      "Sounds gross, but mucus traps viruses and clears them from the body. If your nasal passages are too dry, germ invaders have an easier time. If the dryness is a temporary problem, irrigate your nasal passages with a squeeze bottle or neti pot of saline solution. A humidifier can also help. If dryness is chronic, see your doctor to determine the underlying cause.\n",
      "6. You're always seriously stressed out.\n",
      "It's no coincidence that you tend to catch a cold after a big work deadline.\n",
      "According to a report by the American Psychological Association, long-term stress weakens the responses of your immune system. In addition, \"if you become stressed while you have the flu, your symptoms can get worse,\" says Philip Tierno, director of clinical microbiology and immunology at New York University and author of The Secret Life of Germs: What They Are, Why We Need Them, and How We Can Protect Ourselves Against Them.\n",
      "8 Ways to Lower Stress Levels, Now\n",
      "7. You're always nursing a cold.\n",
      "This means your immune system isn't operating at top speed.\n",
      "The average adult picks up one to three colds each season that typically last 3 or 4 days. If you get more, your resistance might be low. Getting more sleep, regular exercise and rounding out your diet to get lots of healthy veggies and these foods can help.\n",

      "The officers who patrol the metal detectors and corridors of the Capitol Hill complex are earning some of the best pay and benefits in the business. A new government report shows the U.S. Capitol Police, or USCP, provides top-shelf pay when officers sign up and top-shelf benefits when they retire.\n",

      "The GAO compared Capitol Police benefits with those of nine other federal forces. The only other force with starting pay at the same level is the Supreme Court Police.\n",
      "The rest -- including Secret Service Uniformed Division and Pentagon Police -- have lower starting salaries. The lowest, for the National Institutes of Health Police, is about $39,000.\n",
      "The USCP pay is well above the starting salary for a member of the Washington, D.C., city police force -- that paycheck is $48,716. And the USCP starting pay is more than twice what recent college graduates have been earning lately. A Rutgers study last year found college grads entering the workforce in 2009 and 2010 were earning a median starting salary of $27,000.\n",
      "Part of the reason the Capitol Police have higher pay may be because the force has what the report described as a \"wider variety of duties\" than other federal agencies. Officers protect members of Congress but also patrol the congressional buildings and parkland. They handle traffic duties and respond to suspicious packages, and they provide protective service for lawmakers' family members.\n",
      "The force has investigative duties but generally defers to the city's Metropolitan Police Department for the very serious offenses. According to an MPD document, Capitol Police handles criminal investigations on Capitol grounds, except in the case of homicides and serious sex offenses -- those are taken over by the MPD, with Capitol Police assisting.\n",
      "The GAO report was prepared after the police union floated several proposals for improving the benefits system. The Capitol Police Labor Committee proposed condensing the pay scale and raising the mandatory retirement age.\n",
      "Under current policy, the police force requires officers in most cases to retire at 57. The union wants to raise that to 60 so some officers can work longer if they wish.\n",
      "The GAO said that would have a \"minimal impact\" on costs while increasing the officers' retirement. But the Office of Personnel Management called the move \"unnecessary,\" saying the officers' healthy benefits make retirement at 57 \"economically feasible.\"\n",
      "Labor Committee Chairman Jim Konczos said his group was \"dismayed\" by that finding.\n",
      "\"We were very shocked that OPM came back and said that it wasn't necessary,\" he said.\n",
      "He said the union will continue to push for raising the mandatory age, and changing up the pay scale so rank-and-file officers get bigger raises faster.\n",

      "Newt Gingrich, on the verge of resurrecting his campaign, is aiming for his first primary win in Saturday's South Carolina contest as he puts Mitt Romney on the defensive over his tax records and fends off questions about his personal life.\n",
      "The former House speaker enters the election with rising poll numbers and the publicity from two strong debate performances at his back.\n",
      "Romney, who had been leading in South Carolina following his decisive win in the New Hampshire primary, acknowledged Friday that the race is now \"neck and neck.\"\n",
      "\"I'm pretty confident, cautiously optimistic,\" Romney said, adding that his campaign will \"go the distance.\"\n",
      "But South Carolina, a state with a history of determining political fortunes, could be a turning point. Voters could reaffirm Romney as the race's front-runner, putting him in solid position going into Florida, or launch Gingrich into position as his top challenger and tee up a protracted battle for delegates.\n",
      "Just one week ago, Romney seemed poised to go three-for-three in the first three contests, a historic feat. Then Gingrich's numbers started to surge following Monday's debate. Then the Iowa GOP announced that new certified results show Rick Santorum, not Romney, actually came out on top in that state's caucuses. Then Rick Perry bowed out, endorsing Gingrich.\n",
      "Romney's campaign was handed a last-minute gift when ABC News announced it had an interview with Gingrich's second wife, Marianne, who claimed Gingrich once sought an \"open marriage.\"\n",
      "But Gingrich used the debate Thursday to shut the story down. He denied the claim, and to the audience's delight turned the tables on the moderator for asking him about the allegation.\n",
      "\"I am appalled that you would begin a presidential debate on a topic like that,\" Gingrich told the CNN moderator. \"To take an ex-wife and make it, two days before the primary, a significant question in a presidential campaign, is as close to despicable as anything I can imagine.\"\n",
      "He added, \"I am frankly astounded that CNN would take trash like that and use it to open a presidential debate.\"\n",
      "Gingrich's opponents mostly shied away from the topic, on the debate stage and the campaign trail.\n",
      "Instead, Romney has tried to put pressure on Gingrich to release a more detailed accounting of the investigation into his ethical problems as House speaker, saying, \"You know it's going to get out ahead of the general election.\"\n",
      "\"Given Speaker Gingrich's newfound interest in disclosure and transparency, and his concern about an 'October surprise,' he should authorize the release of the complete record of the ethics proceedings against him,\" Romney spokeswoman Gail Gitcho said in a statement.\n",
      "In January 1997, Gingrich became the first speaker ever reprimanded and fined for ethics violations, slapped with a $300,000 penalty. He said he'd failed to follow legal advice concerning the use of tax-exempt contributions to advance potentially partisan goals, but he was also cleared of numerous other allegations.\n",
      "Gingrich, though, brushed off Romney's attempt -- an apparent bid to turn the tables on Gingrich for demanding Romney release his tax returns.\n",
      "\"I refuse to take seriously any request from the Romney campaign to disclose anything,\" Gingrich said. \"Because ... they don't want to disclose anything at any level that involves them.\"\n",
      "Romney faced boos from the audience Thursday when he reiterated that he doesn't plan on releasing his tax returns until April. He stood by the position again on Friday. He also pocketed the endorsement of Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Santorum and Ron Paul, who came in second in New Hampshire, appear to be in a battle for third in South Carolina.\n",
      "On his final lap through the state, Santorum campaigned as the Goldilocks candidate -- just right for the state's conservative voters.\n",
      "\"One candidate is too radioactive, a little too hot,\" he said, referring to Gingrich. \"And we have another candidate who is just too darn cold, who doesn't have bold plans,\" he added, speaking of Romney.\n",

      "When Rick Santorum essentially tied in Iowa, he gave his campaign new life. He also guaranteed America would finally learn just how disgusting, vile and despicable the left is in this country. And how major news outlets and one of the most well-known businesses in the world – Google – are complicit in trying to destroy Santorum because he opposes gay marriage.\n",
      "Santorum is the victim of what Reuters partner The Wrap and many other organizations call a “Google problem.” That’s quite the understatement. He was attacked with a Google bomb from Dan Savage, a gay advocate and sex columnist who hates straight people who don’t agree with him. He also thinks they should be silenced, bullied and blackmailed. That’s exactly how he’s treated Santorum.\n",
      "Savage, in an attempt to destroy Santorum on the Internet for all time, held a contest in 2003 and asked readers for the most foul thing they could say to create a new definition for “Santorum.” The dictionary calls that a neologism and readers gave him 3,000 suggestions. In practice, what Savage has done is the lowest form of hate speech. What he picked as a winner is so vile you don’t want to read it or see it or hear it.\n",
      "But you have to. It’s the top Google search term for Santorum, thanks to an extensive lefty campaign to discredit opponents of gay marriage. To ignore it is to ignore a major issue that is impacting the presidential campaign. It’s like hiding your eyes in the face of danger.\n",
      "Savage has been trying to destroy Santorum and Google is helping him do it by refusing to adjust the search. The result leads to the website spreadingSantorum.com, Savage has the following foul definition:\n",
      "\"santorum (san-TOR-um) n. 1. The frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex.\"\n",
      "That 16 word definition says more about the left, Google and the major media than any other words ever written. First, Google, the most dominant search engine on the planet, is a super tech company worth about $215 billion. Just one share of Google goes for roughly $666. (Yes, it really does.) One of the company’s guidelines is “You can make money without doing evil.” You can. They don’t.\n",
      "Google famously has a complex algorithm set up to search sites and determine what the most popular hit is for everything. So Santorum contacted Google and asked for their help. They gave him the back of their hand and refused to do anything. In repsonse to questions from left-leaning Politico, a Google “spokesperson said that Google does not ‘remove content from our search results, except in very limited cases such as illegal content and violations of our webmaster guidelines.’” In other words, they do it whenever they feel like.\n",
      "“I suspect if something was up there like that about Joe Biden, they’d get rid of it,” Santorum told Politico. “If you're a responsible business, you don't let things like that happen in your business that have an impact on the country.”\n",
      "The link to the foul Santorum page is there, but no explanation, apology, nothing. However, when a hate site showed up prominently as readers searched for “Jew,” Google was quick to respond by adding a disclaimer. That reads in part: “If you recently used Google to search for the word ‘Jew,’ you may have seen results that were very disturbing. We assure you that the views expressed by the sites in your results are not in any way endorsed by Google.”\n",
      "And Google, which won’t reveal how it does its search, is always being manipulated as techies try to figure out how best to play the Google game. To them, this is just someone playing that game.\n",
      "But Google isn’t alone in aiding the attack on Santorum. ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC and CNN have all given cover to Savage’s monstrous activities. ABC has been the worst, with “Nightline” doing a nearly six-minute puff piece\n",
      "Correspondent Yunji de Nies said of Savage “he’s not always nice.” That’s about as understated as saying de Nies isn’t always a good journalist. In her piece, she mentioned how “Savage doesn’t hide his politics” and that “he famously went after Republican Rick Santorum.” But she lacked the courage to explain what Savage did in detail. That would have damaged Savage’s credibility as an anti-bullying advocate.\n",
      "That’s right. Much of her piece, and news stories at other outlets, focused on how Savage and his male “partner” have led the “It Gets Better” campaign to discourage bullying of “lesbian, gay, bi, trans and other bullied teens.” Celebrities and even President Obama have done videos for the project. None of the reports noted that Savage, who says he was bullied when he was young, has turned into the personification of what he claims to hate.\n",
      "In other words, the anti-bullying advocate so hailed by the media is also a hypocrite. He disagrees with the very pledge he claims to support, that “everyone deserves to be respected for who they are.” Everyone, that is, except Rick Santorum or anyone else who opposes Savage’s gay agenda.\n",
      "But he remains a media darling. The New York Times magazine devoted more than 5,000 words in June to depicting Savage as “old fashioned” and saying, “Savage’s sex advice puts me in mind of a smart, tough old grandmother, randy yet stern.”\n",
      "His fellow lefties embrace Savage, impressed at how witty he is when he tells HBO’s Bill Maher that he wishes Republicans “were all f--king dead.” Or how he thinks “about f--king the s--t out of Rick Santorum.” Maher’s crowd laughed and applauded at that.\n",
      "And they think his defining attack on Santorum hilarious, even when he resorts to open blackmail. “Saturday Night Live” and Jon Stewart’s “Daily Show” have both made subtle jokes about the attack. Savage told Mother Jones that he might take down the Internet campaign against Santorum for enough cash. “If Rick Santorum wants to make a $5 million donation to [the gay marriage group] Freedom to Marry, I will take it down. Interest starts accruing now.” And Mother Jones' Stephanie Mencimer had to add a joke. “Santorum may want to consider Savage's offer. Otherwise, he's kinda screwed.”\n",
      "This putrid attack isn’t the defining battle of the 2012 election, but it does show you where different organizations stand. If Google continues to allow it, it shows it can’t be trusted with the massive power it has achieved. And no network that embraces Savage as a commentator or promotes his hypocritical charity can be taken seriously.\n",
      "It’s awful to see bullying – especially when news outlets and Google lend a hand.\n",

      "A Saul Alinsky-tied group has been awarded a $56 million federal loan to start up a nonprofit health insurance company -- one of several organizations across the country this week tapped to launch a new network of insurers under the sponsorship of the federal health care overhaul.\n",
      "The Wisconsin group, Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative, was awarded the funding on Tuesday. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, the group is expected to provide coverage statewide within five years after starting on a smaller scale in early 2014.\n",
      "But Americans for Limited Government President Bill Wilson questioned the group's credentials -- given its affiliation and lack of experience in the insurance field.\n",
      "\"The indisputable fact is that Common Ground was an outgrowth of the Alinsky operation in Chicago,\" Wilson said. \"We're not giving money to a group with experience in health care issues or in setting up exchanges. ... We're handing the money to people who have been trained by arguably the single most expert individual on community organizing in the last 100 years.\"\n",
      "Common Ground, a Milwaukee group that dates back to 2004, is an affiliate of the Alinsky-founded Industrial Areas Foundation.\n",
      "Alinsky, who died in 1972, is regarded as the godfather of community organizing but has also emerged as a bogeyman of the right. Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich has weaved Alinsky's name into his campaign message, repeatedly hammering President Obama as an \"Alinsky radical.\" Like Alinsky, Obama traces his political and activist beginnings to the Chicago world of community organizing.\n",
      "Alinsky, author of \"Rules for Radicals,\" began as a trained archeologist and criminologist but made his name by working with low-income minority communities for better working and living conditions -- with a distinctly anti-establishment message which called on the masses to seize power from those who held it.\n",
      "Common Ground, which focuses on social issues in the Milwaukee area, does claim experience in the health care field. The group's top three issues, according to its website, are education, foreclosures and health care.\n",
      "Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative, an offshoot which technically is independent from Common Ground, is new. According to state records, it incorporated in August 2011, just a few months before the loan applications were due. The group announced its formal launch on Tuesday, along with the $56 million loan decision.\n",
      "In a statement, the group said it would bring a \"new approach to affordable, quality health insurance.\" The organization said it researched possible health insurance solutions for three years before deciding to apply for the Affordable Care Act funding.\n",
      "\"As a small business owner, I grew tired of the exorbitant increases in health insurance costs with no real additional value. Common Ground Healthcare is a solution to the region's cry for help,\" board President Bob Connolly said in a statement.\n",
      "The statement said the organization would start enrolling people in fall 2013 and plans to hire 30 employees over five years.\n",
      "A representative from the group has not responded to a request for comment from FoxNews.com.\n",
      "The federal loans announced this week were worth a total of nearly $640 million. Six other organizations in seven states received them. The money is meant for the creation of so-called Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans, which will serve as nonprofit, cooperative-style insurance groups which will offer an alternative to other private plans. The goal is to eventually fund one of these groups in every state and the District of Columbia.\n",
      "The latest loans will cover start-up costs and cash reserve requirements. Start-up money must be repaid with interest over five years -- the \"solvency loans\" must be repaid within 15 years. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services stressed in its announcement that the funds can only be tapped \"incrementally as milestones are met,\" and that the program has \"extensive provisions to protect against fraud.\"\n",
      "CMS said the loans were awarded \"on a competitive basis through external and independent expert objective reviews,\" and following approval by officials with private insurance experience.\n",
      "But Wilson said some of the other groups awarded appear to have more experience in the field than the Wisconsin organization. He said his group would file a Freedom of Information Act request to the government to find out more about the process.\n",
      "Wilson described the transaction as a \"huge wad of money in a swing state.\"\n",
      "Republican Rep. Dave Camp's office also complained that another group, the Freelancers Union, was awarded more than $340 million via federal loans in three states as part of the same program.\n",
      "In a statement, Camp questioned whether the group was even eligible, describing the loan as a \"reward\" for \"political friends.\"\n",

      "President Obama is facing a new legal challenge to three recess appointments he made to the National Labor Relations Board earlier this month. Mark Mix, President of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation (NRWLDF), says the president's actions have created \"a constitutional crisis.\"\n",
      "Mix, and others critical of the appointments, say Obama has stepped beyond the powers granted to the executive branch. They argue that since the Senate remained in session throughout the holidays, he had no authority to make recess appointments. Mix adds, \"I think what he said is, 'I don't care what the Constitution says here, process be damned, I'm going to do what I want.'\"\n",
      "The White House is relying on a memo from the Justice Department issued Jan. 6, two days after the appointments were made. The memo, authored by Assistant Attorney General Virginia Seitz, states that the president \"may properly determine that the Senate is not available under the Recess Appointments Clause when, while in recess, it holds pro forma sessions where no business can be conducted.\"\n",
      "Some constitutional experts are backing President Obama, including Ian Millhiser of the Center for American Progress. According to Millhiser, \"Someone showing up for thirty seconds, they hit the gavel twice, and then they're gone - that's not a real Senate session.\"\n",
      "The practice was started by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) during the final two years of then-President George W. Bush's second term. Reid said on Sunday that it won't work for Republicans this time around, instead predicting that President Obama's recent recess appointments will withstand legal challenges.\n",
      "But critics are pointing to another legal memo from the Justice Department that they claim is in conflict with the one issued Jan. 6 - and it comes from one of Obama's allies. In 2010, then-Solicitor General, now Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan authored a letter to the Supreme Court Clerk's Office with respect to recess appointments. While noting the president does have authority to make such appointments, Kagan added \"... the Senate may act to foreclose this option by declining to recess for more than two or three days at a time...\" In her Jan. 6th memo, Seitz addressed the 2010 Kagan memo and determined that it was not on point.\n",
      "A number of additional business groups are joining with NRWLDF to ask that a federal judge, who is already hearing a related case involving the parties, add their new objection to the recess appointments to the existing case. There is no timeframe for a ruling.\n",

      "Santorum has since declared victory, claiming Romney has even called to concede.\n",
      "But not fast.\n",
      "The Iowa GOP would not declare an official winner, saying results from eight precincts were still missing. And Romney's campaign is denying the former Massachusetts governor conceded the race.\n",
      "Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul acknowledged that Romney called Santorum, but said it was only \"to congratulate him on the Iowa results.\"\n",
      "Apparently that's not a concession in Romney's book, though Santorum's campaign is taking it that way. And Santorum's folks seemed taken aback by Romney's objection.\n",
      "\"(Romney) called him to congratulate him on the way the votes turned out in Iowa. We took that as a concession,\" Santorum spokesman Hogan Gidley told Fox News.\n",
      "The spokesman later told Fox News that after being told Romney is denying that there was a concession, Santorum said: \"Well then, what was he calling to congratulate me for? Being here in South Carolina?\"\n",
      "The dispute over the meaning of Romney's congratulatory phone call to Santorum would seem a fitting end to the Iowa certification process -- a process marred by confusion and conflicting accounts all along.\n",
      "The totals reported just after the Jan. 3 ballots had given Romney a narrow, eight-vote win over Santorum. It gave an early boost to Romney's bid for the Republican presidential nomination.\n",
      "But officials discovered inaccuracies in 131 precincts, with changes in one precinct alone shifting the vote by 50.\n",
      "The Iowa GOP put the certified numbers at 29,839 for Santorum and 29,805 for Romney, with a turnout of 121,503.\n",
      "\"It's a split decision,\" the executive director of the Iowa GOP Chad Olsen told the Des Moines Register.\n",
      "Iowa GOP Chairman Matt Strawn deflected blame over the inability of his state to provide a definitive count. He said there's \"room for human error\" in such a close contest. In reference to the leaders of the precincts where results are missing, he said, \"I can't speak to why they weren't responding to the calls of our staff.\"\n",
      "He said it's nevertheless clear that Santorum received the most certified vote results in Iowa.\n",
      "Santorum's campaign declared victory in a statement Thursday morning, suggesting the surprise ending to the historically close Iowa caucuses has helped undercut the aura of \"inevitability\" around Romney.\n",
      "\"We've had two early state contests with two winners,\" Santorum spokesman Gidley said.\n",
      "\"Conservatives can now see and believe they don't have to settle for Romney, the Establishment's moderate candidate. ... This latest defeat of Governor Romney in Iowa is just the beginning, and Rick Santorum is committed to continuing the fight as the clear, consistent conservative voice in this race.\"\n",
      "Romney won the New Hampshire primary by a wide margin, claiming back-to-back wins going into South Carolina. The announcement out of Iowa deprives him of that claim, though political analysts said it probably wouldn't do much to shake up the race -- particularly with the cloud of confusion still hanging over the results.\n",
      "Santorum's lead may have been wider than the certified results suggest. Don Lucas, the GOP chairman in Lee County where results from four precincts were missing, told Fox News that the vote totals there showed Santorum up by 26 -- which would bring his statewide advantage to 60.\n",
      "Though the official form with the totals was missing, Lucas still had access to the unofficial totals. Those results, though, still don't count the final tallies from the other four missing precincts.\n",
      "Romney released a new statement acknowledging the vote in Iowa was too close to call.\n",
      "\"The results from Iowa caucus night revealed a virtual tie. I would like to thank the Iowa Republican Party for their careful attention to the caucus process, and we once again recognize Rick Santorum for his strong performance in the state,\" Romney said. \"The Iowa caucuses, with record turnout, were a great start to defeating President Obama in Iowa and elsewhere in the general election.\"\n",

      "Thinking underwear for warriors\n",
      "By Allison Barrie\n",
      "advertisement\n",
      "Editors' Note: Due to an editing error, a prior version of this article incorrectly identified the acronym BDU. The error has been corrected below.\n",
      "Just don’t call them Underoos.\n",
      "Technically known as a “wear and forget physiological sensing system,” thinking undergarments may be the next-generation drawers for the modern warfighter.\n",
      "Gel-free sensors form an electronic network in the fabric to monitor respiration and heart rate, activity, body posture and skin temperature -- relaying that data through the warfighters’ layers of clothing to a central system. The technology could provide an unprecedented capability not just to monitor warfighters during combat and identify critical casualties but also to train and select for missions.\n",
      "The U.S. Army Medical Research and Material Command office (USAMRMC) and the Telemedicine & Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) have been working with Foster-Miller and Malden Mills Industries to create the new low-cost knitted undergarments (photographs of the work in progress aren't available yet). One of their main objectives: to make the high-tech textiles super comfortable, so warfighters will indeed comply and wear them -- that’s where the whole “wear and forget” part comes in.\n",
      "While it’s possible to integrate the sensors into the battle dress uniform (BDU in military-speak), the focus has been on a plug and play undie approach that would stand alone and wouldn’t add cost to existing standard issue.\n",
      "Ultimately, intelligent undergarments could provide data on factors such as altitude adaptation, burn and blunt trauma, blood volume, metabolic activity, CBRN exposure, life sign detection and respiratory distress -- data that that predictive algorithms could be exploited.\n",
      "And with acoustic sensors, the underpants could assess ballistic impact and thoracic sounds for trauma.\n",
      "Current approaches to monitoring warfighters generally involve an awkward chest strap with an attached electronics unit that relays limited and at times unreliable information. Even basic Life Sign Detection Systems have proven beyond reach for many companies rendering their systems unfit for deployment\n",
      "The Army Warfighter Physiological Status Monitoring System made considerable progress and measures heart and respiratory rate, activity, fluid consumption, skin and core body temperature, posture, activity and ballistic impact.\n",
      "Aside from the chestband, companies working in the commercial space such as Bodywear tend to focus on armbands or vests, like VivoMetrics’ “Life shirt.”\n",
      "This intelligent undergarment could be an excellent tool to train leaders to understand the physical limits of their warfighters. For the warfighter, it would be useful to help distinguish between real and perceived physical limitations, helping them push past these perceptions and improve performance.\n",
      "Rate of injury in training may also be reduced by utilizing close bone and muscle monitoring that this technology could provide.\n",
      "In terms of mission selection, with the physical status data that the undergarments could provide on warfighters and units, a leader may be better able to identify those most fit for the job.\n",
      "While deployed, data from the undergarments could allow leaders to monitor performance readiness, alert a leader to performance impairment and perhaps most importantly assess the ability of their warfighter to continue or complete the mission.\n",
      "Fatigue is always a challenge and can erode performance. The undergarments could identify fatigue signals and alert the warfighter or leader that fatigue countermeasures should be exercised to ensure performance either in training or in an operational environment.\n",
      "When warfighters are operating in a remote area or working in CBRN protective suits, the undergarments could be particularly useful for monitoring their health.\n",
      "A command center could remotely monitor the physical status of each warfighter and would be immediately alerted if a warfighter was injured together with detailed data from the sensors.\n",
      "For the medic in the field in the thick of it, the undergarments could provide information in advance of reaching the casualty to assist in more rapid assessment and effective triage. It could also prevent a medic from unnecessarily risking his life by notifying the medic that a warfighter is already dead.\n",
      "In the conduct of contemporary warfare, warfighters are required to master and run ever increasingly complicated technologies such as targeting and weapons systems. For example pilots, whether fighter jet or helicopter, are responsible for extremely expensive advanced aircraft all requiring a high and constant degree of cognitive readiness in spite of often operating in superhuman lengths of shifts – maintaining this readiness could usefully be monitored back at HQ.\n",
      "Training professional athletes, monitoring the health of employees working in hazardous or industrial environments, telemedicine, civilian medical care and the exercise and health market in general are just a few of the other wider applications where the technology could be useful.\n",
      "Right now this promising sensor system technology is in textile development -- but the ultimate goal is to make it work, and soon.\n",

      "Israeli officials say they won't warn the U.S. if they decide to launch a pre-emptive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities, one U.S. intelligence official familiar with the discussions told the Associated Press. The pronouncement, delivered in a series of private, top-level conversations, sets a tense tone ahead of meetings in the coming days at the White House and Capitol Hill.\n",
      "Israeli officials said that if they eventually decide a strike is necessary, they would keep the Americans in the dark to decrease the likelihood that the U.S. would be held responsible for failing to stop Israel's potential attack. The U.S. has been working with the Israelis for months to persuade them that an attack would be only a temporary setback to Iran's nuclear program.\n",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak delivered the message to a series of top-level U.S. visitors to the country, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the White House national security adviser and the director of national intelligence, and top U.S. lawmakers, all trying to close the trust gap between Israel and the U.S. over how to deal with Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n",
      "Netanyahu delivered the same message to all the Americans who have traveled to Israel for talks, the U.S. official said.\n",
      "The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive strategic negotiations.\n",
      "The White House did not respond to requests for comment, and the Pentagon and Office of Director of National Intelligence declined to comment, as did the Israeli Embassy.\n",
      "Iran claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the International Atomic Energy Agency has raised alarms that its uranium enrichment program might be a precursor to building nuclear weapons. The US has said it does not know whether the government has decided to weaponize its nuclear material and put it on a missile or other delivery device.\n",
      "The secret warning is likely to worry US officials and begin the high level meetings with Israel and the US far apart on how to handle Iran.\n",
      "But the apparent decision to keep the U.S. in the dark also stems from Israel's frustration with the White House. After a visit by National Security Adviser Tom Donilon in particular, they became convinced the Americans would neither take military action, nor go along with unilateral action by Israel against Iran. The Israelis concluded they would have to conduct a strike unilaterally -- a point they are likely to hammer home in a series of meetings over the next two weeks in Washington, the official said.\n",
      "Barak will meet with top administration and congressional officials during his visit. Netanyahu arrives in Washington for meetings with President Barack Obama next week.\n",
      "The behind-the-scenes warning belies the publicly united front the two sides have attempted to craft with the shuttle diplomacy to each other's capitals.\n",
      "\"It's unprecedented outreach to Israel to make sure we are working together to develop the plan to deter Iran from developing a nuclear weapon,\" and to keep them from exporting terrorism, said Maryland Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee.\n",
      "He traveled there with the intelligence committee chairman, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., to meet Israel's prime minister and defense minister, along with other officials.\n",
      "\"We talked about the fact that sanctions are working and they are going to get a lot more aggressive,\" Ruppersberger added.\n",
      "They also discussed talked about presenting a unified front to Iran, to counter the media reports that the two countries are at odds over how and when to attack Iran.\n",
      "\"We have to learn from North Korea. All those (peace) talks and stalling and they developed a nuclear weapon,\" he said. \"We are going to send a message, enough is enough, the stalling is over. ... All options are on the table.\"\n",
      "\"I got the sense that Israel is incredibly serious about a strike on their nuclear weapons program,\" Rogers told CNN on Monday. \"It's their calculus that the administration ... is not serious about a real military consequence to Iran moving forward.\n",
      "\"They believe they're going to have to make a decision on their own, given the current posture of the United States,\" he added.\n",
      "U.S. intelligence and special operations officials have tried to keep a dialogue going with Israel, despite the high-level impasse, sharing with them options such as allowing Israel to use U.S. bases in the region from which to launch such a strike, as a way to make sure the Israelis give the Americans a heads-up, according to the U.S. official, and a former U.S. official with knowledge of the communications\n",
      "Cooperation has improved on sharing of intelligence in the region, according to one current and one former U.S. official. Israel is providing key information on Syria for instance, now that the U.S. has closed its embassy and pulled out both its diplomats and intelligence officials stationed there, the U.S. official said.\n",

      "A little extra time off this winter left David Toms and Camilo Villegas feeling fresh for the Humana Challenge.\n",
      "Toms and Villegas shot 9-under 63 to top a leaderboard dotted with impressive scores in the opening round Thursday.\n",
      "Ted Potter Jr., Sang-moon Bae, Brandt Snedeker and Bob Estes were one stroke behind in postcard-perfect weather on the pro-am tournament's three generous Palm Springs-area courses.\n",
      "Villegas and Toms both played bogey-free at the erstwhile Bob Hope Classic, which has dropped one day of its traditional five-round format this year.\n",
      "After playing on the winning U.S. team in the Presidents Cup, Toms passed on a hard-to-get spot in the lucrative Chevron World Challenge in December to spend extra time with his family. He shook off an unimpressive start to the new season in Hawaii with excellent play alongside Presidents Cup teammate Phil Mickelson at La Quinta Country Club, which features the tournament's toughest course.\n",
      "Toms also got a boost playing alongside Mickelson, who struggled to a 74. Toms made a 30-foot birdie putt on the sixth hole right after Mickelson holed an eagle putt, ratcheting up the energy in an often staid tournament.\n",
      "\"That's probably the biggest crowd I've ever had playing golf here,\" Toms said. \"It was nice to play a good round and have people energized and out there cheering for your birdies.\"\n",
      "Villegas recovered from his disappointing 2011 with an extended break in his native Colombia and Florida. In his tournament debut, he made nine birdies in his first crack at the Nicklaus Private course, coasting through a round he could barely recall after he finished it.\n",
      "\"You feel that you're a little rusty, but at the same time, you're mentally fresh,\" said Villegas, a three-time PGA Tour winner. \"It's a funny game. Sometimes being mentally fresh is more important.\"\n",
      "The Humana Challenge has been invigorated by multiple changes including its new title sponsor, an increased purse and a partnership with the Clinton Foundation to promote healthy lifestyles. Bill Clinton, who will play alongside old friend Greg Norman on Saturday, showed up to the event Thursday.\n",
      "Enthusiastic crowds also showed up in the Coachella Valley to cheer on an improved field including Mickelson, defending champion Jhonattan Vegas and world No. 8 Dustin Johnson, who matched Norman at 72 in the Shark's first Palm Springs appearance since 1986.\n",
      "Toms and Villegas aren't the only players using the week to round into form for bigger challenges ahead. Rough spots in their games are more easily fixed in Palm Springs' perfect weather — although rain could be headed to the valley for the weekend.\n",
      "\"Nothing really worked,\" Norman said after his first PGA Tour start since 2009. \"It was just pure rust, that's all it was. Just rusty, rusty, rusty.\"\n",
      "Potter made five consecutive birdies after the turn in his round, while the 45-year-old Estes, who hasn't won since 2002, finished with consecutive birdies to move into a third-place tie.\n",
      "Another change to the tournament was an immediate hit with the pros: Instead of playing with three amateur partners in each of the first four rounds, two pros are teaming with two players, which makes for more fun.\n",
      "\"I've looked at the pairings, and I can tell that a lot of guys are playing with their friends and other golfers, the guys that are close,\" said Toms, who counts Mickelson as a close friend.\n",

      "To reach his office in Galveston National Laboratory, where scientists study deadly pathogens such as the Ebola and Marburg viruses, director James Le Duc swipes his key card at the building's single entrance, which is guarded 24/7 by Texas state police.\n",
      "As he walks the hallways, more than 100 closed-circuit cameras watch him. Seven more locked doors stand between him and his destination. Entering a research lab requires another card swipe and, for labs housing especially dangerous microbes, a fingerprint scan.\n",
      "To keep deadly viruses from escaping, each lab uses negative air flow and dedicated exhaust systems. Workers wear full-body air-supplied suits. To test its security, Galveston ran an exercise with the Federal Bureau of Investigation simulating a would-be intruder and another, with the University of Texas, war-gaming a campus shooter. The facility passed both tests.\n",
      "Galveston's strict security underlines a little-known fact about hundreds of labs working with bacteria and viruses that could make the 1918-19 Spanish flu epidemic - when as many as 40 million people died - seem like a summer cold. Many of the precautions it takes are not required by law.\n",
      "\"A lock on the door is the only specified requirement,\" said Rutgers University virologist Richard Ebright. \"There is no explicit requirement for guards, bio-identity checks, or video monitoring like 7-Elevens have. The rules require very strict paperwork but no real physical security.\"\n",
      "Labs whose experiments on dangerous pathogens are funded by the U.S. government must follow specific rules to keep the microbes from escaping, but those rules are not enforceable for researchers working with private funds. Outside the country, security and safety requirements vary widely, experts say.\n",
      "\"It's all subject to interpretation,\" said a scientist close to the U.S. National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, which monitors research that might pose a bioterrorism threat.\n",
      "If a lab receiving U.S. government funding violates the guidelines, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can cut off the flow of money, \"but it can't shut you down,\" the scientist said. \"I don't have a lot of confidence in our biosafety right now.\"\n",
      "Immediate concern over bird flu research\n",
      "Questions about biosafety - keeping dangerous microbes from escaping labs - and biosecurity - keeping out bad actors intent on releasing or stealing the pathogens - are front and center for global health officials due to a growing controversy over experiments with the bird flu virus.\n",
      "Scientists and government officials will meet on Thursday and Friday at the World Health Organization in Geneva to hash out the safest way to deal with the studies and address fears that lab-engineered viruses could either escape or be used as a bioterror weapon.\n",
      "Last year, labs at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and Erasmus MC in Rotterdam independently created mutant forms of avian influenza, known as H5N1, that can be transmitted directly among mammals. The natural strain can be caught only through close contact with infected birds.\n",
      "One immediate question is what level of safety should be required for that research. So far, it has been conducted at biosafety-level 3 labs. Under U.S. guidelines, BSL-3 applies to agents that cause \"serious or lethal disease\" but do not ordinarily spread between people and for which treatments or preventives exist. BSL-4 applies to agents with no preventives or treatment.\n",
      "The Wisconsin and Erasmus scientists received approval to conduct their experiments under BSL-3 conditions because, they argued, antiviral drugs can treat avian flu. Erasmus was subject to U.S. guidelines because its experiments were funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n",
      "\"The viruses generated here are sensitive to influenza antivirals\" so they fit the BSL-3 criteria, said Rebecca Moritz of the University of Wisconsin's Office of Biological Safety. There are \"multiple physical barriers and the facilities are monitored at all times.\"\n",
      "All lab workers there wear disposable jumpsuits and powered respirators in addition to scrubs, shoes, shoe covers, and double gloves, she said. Each time scientists leave the lab, they must remove their protective equipment and shower before putting on their street clothes. Erasmus does the same.\n",
      "The labs said they have emergency and security plans for a wide variety of threats. Neither would provide specifics on those security measures on the grounds the details could aid any would-be attackers.\n",
      "Such precautions are not foolproof, however. According to a 2009 report by the Government Accountability Office, there were 400 accidents at BSL-3 labs in the United States in the previous decade.\n",
      "Some scientists therefore argue that the experiments creating contagious H5N1 mutants should be done only at BSL-4 facilities.\n",
      "\"An escape would still produce the worst pandemic in history,\" said Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota and a member of the NSABB, at a symposium at the New York Academy of Sciences this month.\n",
      "\"The risk of this agent, if in fact it can be readily transmitted between humans, is catastrophic,\" he told Reuters. \"Until we know how this virus actually acts in humans, I think you have no choice but to move this (research) to BSL-4.\"\n",
      "Space suits\n",
      "BSL-4 labs, like the one in Galveston, have all the BSL-3 precautions and are also in isolated facilities with dedicated exhaust, vacuum, and other systems to prevent escape. In addition, workers must wear what are essentially space suits.\n",
      "But the BSL guidelines relate to biosafety, not security.\n",
      "The debate over H5N1 experiments has also raised the question of how secure BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs are. It has assumed a greater urgency as the number of known U.S. BSL-3 labs has surged from 415 in 2004 to 1,495 in 2010.\n",
      "Hundreds or thousands of BSL-3 laboratories may be unknown, however, because \"no federal agency is required to track the number of biocontainment labs,\" found a 2011 report by the National Research Council, an arm of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.\n",
      "Globally, BSL-3 labs have recently been built or are under construction in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, China, Brazil, and Mexico, among others, the NRC found. Yet \"many countries have few or no regulations,\" the NRC concluded.\n",
      "BSL-4 labs are also proliferating. A 2011 workshop in Istanbul organized by the NRC was told that there are 24 BSL-4 facilities, including in Germany, Gabon, Sweden, Russia, South Africa and Canada. The United States has six, including Le Duc's, which is part of the University of Texas Medical Branch.\n",
      "\"We are now in a proliferation race for BSL-3 and 4 labs,\" said Laurie Garrett, the senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. \"Having such a facility is a mark of national sophistication. But the spread of these labs allows the unfettered proliferation of the world's most dangerous microbes.\"\n",
      "Indeed, deadly microbes have escaped high-security labs. Between 1978 and 1999, just over 1,200 people acquired infections from BSL-4 labs around the world; 22 were fatal. Since then, lab workers have been killed by Ebola and SARS, or severe acquired respiratory syndrome. Thieves tried to steal animal pathogens from an Indonesian lab in 2007, the NRC workshop was told.\n",
      "Guidelines, not law\n",
      "U.S. research on dangerous human pathogens must follow safety guidelines set by the CDC. They may or may not be followed at labs elsewhere in the world, concluded the NRC workshop.\n",
      "In part, that is because BSL-3 and BSL-4 designations \"have very wide interpretations,\" said Ren Salerno, senior manager for cooperative threat reduction programs at Sandia National Laboratories, part of the U.S. Department of Energy.\n",
      "Although U.S. government-funded research must adhere to biosafety guidelines, they \"do not have the force of law,\" said Ebright. \"If you're a private lab, privately funded, there is no requirement that you comply.\" The CDC declined to make a spokesperson available to discuss biosafety and biosecurity.\n",
      "Many labs in developing countries say they adhere to guidelines as tough as those applied to U.S. facilities. If they receive U.S. funding, lab personnel must pass an FBI security risk assessment, for instance.\n",
      "In Thailand, police check the background of all staff members and require fingerprints to access freezers containing microbes.\n",
      "A BSL-4 lab in Australia employs a security staff of 10. It is housed in a fenced, isolated building and has infrared cameras to detect intruders. Gabon's BSL-4 lab is surrounded by electric fences and has a guard on duty at all times. Only three people know the code to the freezer holding Ebola.\n",
      "U.S. biosecurity requirements are laid out in the 2001 Patriot Act, which says that facilities storing \"select agents\" - microbes and toxins that could be used as bioweapons - must develop and implement a plan to keep them secure. Such labs must also provide the government the names of everyone with access to the pathogens; none can be on a terrorism watch list.\n",
      "Experts dismiss Hollywood's nightmare scenarios such as bombing a BSL-4 lab or crashing a 737 jumbo jet into one.\n",
      "\"The one nice thing about pathogens is that they'll self-destruct under intense heat,\" said Salerno.\n",
      "What Salerno does give credence to is either an accidental escape or a plot to steal a pathogen by lab employees acting on their own or under duress.\n",
      "\"As more of this kind of research occurs, and it will, especially internationally, the risks of both accidental release or potential theft and misuse will increase as well,\" Salerno said. \"The science is way ahead of governments' ability to regulate the science.\"\n",

      "By Loren Grush\n",
      "advertisement\n",
      "While women have typically been found to have higher rates of dementia than men, a new study has revealed that men are the ones with a higher risk for mild memory loss than their female counterparts.\n",
      "Researchers from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., observed a condition in elderly individuals known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the type of mild memory loss that is typically a precursor to dementia.\n",
      "Dr. R.O. Roberts, the author of the study and a member of the American Academy of Neurology, said they observed a group of 1,450 individuals aged 70 – 89 over the course of three years, giving them real results in real time.\n",
      "“Our study is important because a lot of studies at the time usually would go back through previously collected MCI criteria to use as data for the diagnosis,” Roberts said. “Our study was different in the sense that we were able to use criteria for the diagnosis of MCI at the time we saw them and not look back and retrospectively apply the diagnosis.”\n",
      "At the onset of the study in 2004, none of the patients had diagnosis of dementia. Over the course of the three years, the subjects had to undergo memory testing and evaluations every 15 months. They discussed their memory, went through formal cognitive testing and saw a physician to evaluate for any other conditions.\n",
      "By the end of the testing period, 296 of the 1,450 subjects developed MCI. The new cases in men per year were higher, at 72 out of 1,000, compared to 57 out of 1,000 in women.\n",
      "Another interesting finding from the research showed the disparity in MCI cases between the genders was greater in those aged 70 – 74. But in the older age groups, aged 85 – 89, the disparity in MCI cases was practically non-existent.\n",
      "“The fact that we see a higher risk in men at an earlier age raises the question that the risk factors for MCI may be starting earlier for men and women, or occurring at a higher frequency for men than in women,” Roberts said. “It’s important to address or prevent risk factors at earlier ages than we’re currently doing – such as when people are in their 20s or 30s.”\n",
      "Risk factors for MCI include low levels of education, diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, as well as lack of exercise and a lack of mental stimulation. Now with the discovery of MCI difference in men and women, Roberts said it’s also important to look at risk factors separately for the sexes.\n",
      "More importantly, Roberts noted that MCI is an important condition to study further because life expectancy continues to increase.\n",
      "“Increasingly more people are receiving the diagnosis of MCI,” Roberts said. “People thought that memory problems were just problems of aging, but MCI’s different in that the impairments in memory and in other thinking skills are beyond what you expect for a person’s age and level of education and what you expect when you compare them to their peers.”\n",
      "The study was published Wednesday in the online issue of Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.\n",

      "The Sixers improved to 2-1 on the residency Friday when Lou Williams scored 17 points to lead a balanced Philadelphia attack as the 76ers easily handled Charlotte, 89-72, leading wire-to-wire and by as many as 30 points.\n",
      "Jrue Holiday celebrated his own bobblehead night by adding 15 points and Jodie Meeks contributed 14 for the Atlantic division-leading Sixers, who avoided losing back-to-back games for the first time this season. Thaddeus Young also reached double figures with 10 points off the bench.\n",
      "\"A very good win for us tonight from the standpoint of I really like the way we came out defensively and were very aggressive,\" said Sixers coach Doug Collins. \"We really moved the ball well in that first half.\"\n",
      "Philadelphia held the Bobcats to just 38.6 percent shooting and were able to rest many of their key contributors.\n",
      "\"To not have guys play heavy minutes is a real blessing,\" Collins said.\n",
      "Centers Spencer Hawes (strained left Achilles) and Nikola Vucevic (hyperextended left knee/strained left quadriceps) remained out of the lineup for Philly. Hawes indicated he could play tonight but the team is likely targeting his return for Monday against Dwight Howard and the Magic. The rookie Vucevic, meanwhile, remains day-to-day.\n",
      "Philadelphia, which is 9-2 this season at WFC, will finish its residency with games against much tougher competition: Orlando, Chicago and Miami.\n",
      "The Pistons, who are opening up a four-game road trip tonight that will also feature visits to Milwaukee, New York and New Jersey, dropped their third straight on Friday, a 107-101 overtime loss to Atlanta in Auburn Hills.\n",
      "Greg Monroe paced Detroit with 22 points and 11 boards while rookie Brandon Knight contributed 20 points and a career- high eight assists as the Pistons lost for the 13th time in 15 games. Jason Maxiell added a season-high 19 points off the bench in defeat.\n",
      "\"We take every loss personally, not just a close loss. I think every loss is a personal loss,\" Knight said. \"You just don't favor one over the other, but this one will hurt a little bit more.\"\n",
      "The banged-up Pistons were without guards Ben Gordon (sore left shoulder) and Will Bynum (sprained right foot) as well as forwards Tayshaun Prince (family issue) and Charlie Villanueva (sprained right ankle). None are expected back in Philadelphia tonight as Detroit attempts to improve on its dismal 1-8 road record.\n",
      "The Sixers have won two of their last three games against the Pistons, including a 96-73 rout at the Wells Fargo Center back on Jan. 6 behind Meeks' 21 points.\n",
      "Collins, however, thinks the Pistons are tougher than they seem.\n",

      "The Ducks haven't lost to the Flames at home since a 5-1 defeat on Jan. 19, 2004 — Calgary's only regulation win in its last 24 visits to Anaheim (1-13-10). The Flames' last seven games at Honda Center have resulted in one-goal losses, five of them either in overtime or a shootout.\n",

      "The Flames, three points out of a playoff spot with 29 games left, are trying to avoid a third straight season out of the postseason under coach Brent Sutter. The only time they've missed the postseason three years in a row was 1998-00 when Sutter's brother, Brian, was the coach.\n",
      "If it comes down to the final day of the season, their opponent will be the Ducks in Calgary.\n",

Calgary's Tom Kostopoulos took exception and got a roughing penalty during the ensuing skirmish, leaving Calgary with a 3-minute power play.\n",
      "Iginla capitalized with the man advantage, beating Hiller on a breakaway to the stick side with 13:45 left in regulation off a feed from Olli Jokinen. It was the second breakaway goal in two games for Iginla, who extended his streak of consecutive seasons with 20 or more to 13 — the longest among active players.\n",
      "The Flames got a break when a goal by Ryan Getzlaf was waved off due to a goaltender interference penalty against Corey Perry at 8:23 of the first. But the Ducks eventually opened the scoring at the 15:52 mark when Ryan got the puck in the slot from Lubomir Visnovsky and got his 20th goal on a 30-foot wrist shot while Perry was screening Kiprusoff.\n",
      "Beleskey added his fourth of the season at 17:51, redirecting Sheldon Brookbank's one-timer from the right point past Kiprusoff's stick. The 2006 Vezina Trophy winner remained one victory shy of becoming the 27th goalie in NHL history with at least 300 regular-season wins.\n",
      "Tanguay got the Flames on the board at 4:41 of the second with his sixth goal and first in four games since returning from a neck injury that sidelined him for 15 games. He converted a pass from behind the net by Blair Jones and scored from the edge of the crease just 2 seconds after Calgary killed off an elbowing penalty against Kostopoulos.\n",
      "Jones received a double-minor for cutting Teemu Selanne with a high stick after Scott Hannan was sent off for interference, giving Anaheim a two-man advantage for 1:36 later in the period. Kiprusoff made three saves during the 5-on-3 power play, and Saki Koivu fired two pucks off the post.\n",
      "Notes: Koivu has gone 11 games without a goal since his hat trick Jan. 10 against Dallas. ... Eleven of the last 14 meetings between the teams have been decided by one goal. ... The season-low turnout of 12,096 represented the Ducks' fifth crowd this season under 13,000. ... Hiller stopped Jokinen on a breakaway about 11 minutes into the first period, but Jokinen got the puck past him in the first round of the shootout. ...

      "IOC steps up fight against illegal betting\n",
      "advertisement\n",
      "Governments, law enforcement agencies and betting operators agreed Thursday to work more closely together to fight illegal betting and corruption in sports.\n",
      "The International Olympic Committee held a summit meeting of sports federation leaders and representatives of the United Nations, European Union and the international police agency Interpol.\n",
      "\"There was a consensus around the table that sporting fraud should be a criminal offense,\" IOC director general Christophe De Kepper told The Associated Press. \"A lot needs to be done on the government side and the cooperation between police and justice around the world. There is a sense of urgency.\"\n",
      "One year after the IOC opened talks to coordinate anti-corruption efforts, delegates reviewed progress reports from three working groups and agreed to create a panel to monitor progress worldwide.\n",
      "Still, six months before the London Olympics, sports bodies were urged to advise athletes and their entourages how to protect themselves from approaches by an illegal gambling industry believed to be worth tens of billions of dollars annually.\n",
      "\"International federations were instructed to go ahead and produce relevant guidelines,\" British Sports Minister Hugh Robertson told the AP. \"That is going to happen a lot more quickly than creating legislation.\"\n",
      "The IOC cited Britain, France and Australia as models for enacting laws that empowered investigations and prosecutions of match-fixing and corrupt gambling.\n",
      "\"We hope that this example will be imposed upon others, and sooner or later they will be encouraged and forced to adopt similar rules,\" De Kepper said.\n",
      "Robertson told delegates how English law allowed authorities to convict and jail three Pakistan cricketers last year in a fixing scandal.\n",
      "\"There was not a single person in the room who was not aware of the case,\" Robertson said. \"If it can happen at a test match at Lord's (cricket ground), it can happen at the Olympic Games.\"\n",
      "De Kepper said Olympic officials are \"pragmatic\" about how much could be achieved and how quickly. The current project has not directly involved most parts of Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe, where illegal gambling is largely conducted.\n",
      "The Olympic body will continue to lead efforts despite some calls to create an independent global body similar to the World Anti-Doping Agency.\n",
      "\"All are agreeing that increased cooperation is needed and that the IOC coordinating the efforts is the right way to move on with this issue,\" De Kepper said.\n",
      "Talks on how legal betting operators will help finance the initiative are also scheduled for future meetings.\n",
      "Meanwhile, betting firms were urged to share their intelligence in monitoring markets, including with Interpol and organizers of sports events.\n",
      "\"Betting operators also have their obligations to detect the frauds and to transmit this information to prosecutors,\" De Kepper said.\n",

      "Attorney General Eric Holder vigorously denied a \"cover-up\" by the Justice Department over \"Operation Fast and Furious,\" telling a House panel investigating the botched gun-running program that he has nothing to hide and suggesting the probe is a \"political\" effort to embarrass the administration.\n",
      "\"There's no attempt at any kind of cover-up,\" Holder told lawmakers well into a hearing about whether he had been forthright in responding to requests of the House Oversight and Government Relations Committee led by Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif.\n",
      "\"We're not going to be hiding behind any kind of privileges or anything,\" he said.\n",
      "The hearing came after Issa and Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, his Senate partner in the probe, asserted that top Justice officials are covering up events surrounding the flawed gun-smuggling probe.\n",
      "Issa made the accusation in a letter threatening to seek a contempt of Congress ruling against Holder for failing to turn over congressionally subpoenaed documents that were created after problems with Fast and Furious came to light.\n",
      "Republicans also released a report in the hours ahead of the hearing claiming that Justice Department officials \"had much greater knowledge of, and involvement in, Fast and Furious than it has previously acknowledged.\"\n",
      "Asked whether his assistants, Deputy Attorney General Gary Grindler or Assistant Attorney Lanny Breuer, head of the department's Criminal Division, ever authorized gunwalking or the tactics employed in Fast and Furious, Holder responded not to his knowledge.\n",
      "\"Not only did I not authorize those tactics, when I found out about them I told the field and everybody in the United States Department of Justice that those tactics had to stop. That they were not acceptable and that gunwalking was to stop. That was what my reaction [was] to my finding out about the use of that technique,\" he added.\n",
      "He added that he doesn't think that the situation warranted the kind of response Republicans were giving after his department provided thousands of documents, and planned to deliver more.\n",
      "Holder also rejected arguments that his handling of the case had lost him any support for the effort he was putting forth as attorney general.\n",
      "\"I don't think the American people have lost trust in me. ... This has become political, I get that,\" he said.\n",
      "But Holder also said no one has been punished \"yet\" in the case, despite the fact that lost guns from the operation ended up at the crime scene where U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was murdered in December 2010.\n",
      "Terry's family has informed the U.S. government that it has six months to respond to its inquiry into Terry's death or face a $25 million lawsuit.\n",
      "In the botched operation, more than 1,400 weapons sold to low-level straw purchasers believed to be supplying Mexican drug gangs and other criminals were lost during tracking by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents. Another 700 firearms connected to suspects in the investigation have been recovered, some from crime scenes in Mexico and the U.S., including in Nogales, Ariz., where Terry was killed.\n",
      "Holder said he didn't learn about Terry's murder until 24 hours after his death, and at the time did not hear that weapons tied to Fast and Furious were at the scene.\n",
      "\"I didn't know about Operation Fast and Furious until the beginning parts of 2011 after I received that letter from Senator Grassley, I guess at the end of January and then that was about Operation Gun Runner. I actually learned about the Fast and Furious operation in February of that year.\"\n",
      "Holder told the committee, \"I’m not sure exactly how I found out about the term, 'Fast and Furious.'\" He testified repeatedly that he never authorized the controversial tactics employed in the operation.\n",
      "\"There is no attempt at any kind of cover-up,\" Holder said. \"We have shared huge amounts of information\" and will continue to do so, he said.\n",
      "But Holder said under questioning that he has not disciplined anyone for his role in the controversial operation.\n",
      "\"No I have not as yet -- as yet,\" Holder said when questioned by Issa on the matter. \"There have been personnel changes made at ATF. We obviously have a new U.S. attorney in Arizona. We have made personnel switches at ATF. People have been moved out of positions.\"\n",
      "Holder's statements on the Justice Department's role in the operation did not sit well with Republican lawmakers on the committee, who accused the attorney general of intentionally withholding key documents in the case.\n",
      "\"The conclusion that I come to is there are some things in there that's being hidden that you don't want us to see,\" said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind. \"We have every right under the Constitution to check on what you're doing... So for you to deny this committee anything like that is just dead wrong and I don't think you're going to find any way that you can do it.\"\n",
      "Burton went on to say that 93,000 documents related to the operation are being withheld by the Justice Department even though they've been turned over internally to the department's inspector general, a political appointee, Burton said.\n",
      "\"And you're saying, well, the separation of powers prohibits you from (delivering them to Congress). That's baloney. That is just baloney,\" Burton said.\n",
      "Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, also questioned Holder's having not discussed the case with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.\n",
      "\"When people know that I'm going to be the subject of these kinds of hearings, you know six times and all that, nobody necessarily wants to get involved in these kinds of things or get dragged into it,\" Holder responded.\n",
      "Issa told Holder the committee will do what is necessary to obtain the information, \"If you do not find a legitimate basis to deny us the material we've asked for.\"\n",
      "Holder said earlier during testimony that he would release additional materials \"to the extent that I can.\"\n",
      "In Holder's defense, Rep. Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y., claimed the committee has \"not obtained one shred of evidence that would contradict your testimony.\"\n",
      "\"Not one witness, not one document, not one e-mail, and still some continue to suggest that you did personally authorize gunwalking and the tactics in Operation Fast and Furious.\"\n",

The state of Nebraska, which was really at the center of all of this, came up with a different route, that took it away from sensitive aquifers - different sensitive area -- environmental area.\n",
      "As you look at the map, they came up with a new route. And the governor -- Governor Heineman said they were ready to go forward. And the State Department had already approved the more environmentally-sensitive route but they came up with a different route and he's going to put that back in by September. This hearing was quite something.\n",
      "We're back with the panel. Charles, you heard Democrat Henry Waxman point to Koch brothers, the Republican contributors, saying they might have interests in this pipeline.\n",
      "CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Yes, I think we really can't let the moment pass without commenting on the Waxman objection. So this is going to be now a new criterion for evaluating a public policy, something that would create thousands of shovel-ready jobs, that would reduce our dependence on unfriendly sources of oil, that would cement our alliance with Canada, that would have for us and secure a source of oil, that's secure and long range and deny a strategic asset to China. It is something that we ought to reject because it might help the Koch brothers. I mean it's like saying that if Qaddafi's son owned a biotech company that discovered a cure for cancer we would ban its importation lest it helped the Qaddafis. If you can think of a more stupid, intellectually desperate argument on anything I'd like to hear it. And I would address that to Congressman Waxman with the highest and all due respect.\n",

      "advertisement\n",
      "NASA is questioning whether Apollo 13 commander James Lovell has the right to sell a 70-page checklist from the flight that includes his handwritten calculations that were crucial in guiding the damaged spacecraft back to Earth.\n",
      "The document was sold by Heritage Auctions in November for more than $388,000, some 15 times its initial list price. The checklist gained great fame as part of a key dramatic scene in the 1995 film \"Apollo 13\" in which actor Tom Hanks plays Lovell making the calculations.\n",
      "After the sale, NASA contacted Heritage to ask whether Lovell had title to the checklist. Greg Rohan, president of Dallas-based Heritage, said Thursday the sale has been suspended pending the outcome of the inquiry. The checklist, he said, is being stored for now in the company's vault.\n",
      "Rohan said Lovell provided a signed affidavit that he had clear title to the ring-bound checklist, which is standard procedure. Heritage does robust business in space memorabilia and this is the first time NASA has ever raised questions about ownership of its items, he added.\n",
      "\"It's one that is near and dear to our hearts,\" Rohan said of the space collectibles business. \"We, like a lot of people, consider these astronauts to be national heroes.\"\n",
      "The latest inquiry follows a federal lawsuit NASA filed last year in Miami against Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell seeking return of a camera he brought back from his 1971 moon mission. That lawsuit was settled in October when Mitchell agreed to give the camera to NASA, which in turn is donating it to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington.\n",
      "A Nov. 23, 2011, file photo released by Heritage Auctions shows a a key page from the Apollo 13 Lunar Module Checklist with handwriting by Commander James Lovell.\n",
      "NASA spokesman Bob Jacobs said the lawsuit and Lovell inquiry do not represent a broad new agency effort to recover space items.\n",
      "\"It's a challenge to continually monitor the growing auctions community, which is usually how these items come to light,\" he said in an email. \"This latest issue demonstrates a need to reach out to former astronauts and other former agency personnel who may have these kind of items.\"\n",
      "The Apollo 13 moon mission was aborted about 200,000 miles from Earth when an oxygen tank exploded on April 13, 1970, causing another tank to fail and seriously jeopardizing the three-man crew's ability to return home. Astronaut Jack Swigert famously said \"Houston, we've had a problem here\" after the explosion.\n",
      "The crew was forced to move from the command ship into the attached lunar landing module for the return flight. Lovell's calculations on the checklist were key in transferring navigation data from the command craft to the lunar module.\n",
      "NASA has raised questions about title rights for three other space items Heritage had sold in the same November auction. Two were from Apollo 9 astronaut Rusty Schweikart: a lunar module identification plate that brought more than $13,000 and a hand controller that received a $22,705 bid. The space agency also targeted a fourth item, a hand glove worn by Alan Shepard during training for Apollo 14, that brought more than $19,000.\n",
      "In an email to Heritage, NASA Deputy Chief Counsel Donna M. Shafer said there was no indication the agency had ever transferred ownership of any of the items to the astronauts.\n",
      "\"Only NASA has the authority to clear NASA property for sale,\" Shafer said in the email, which was provided by NASA to The Associated Press.\n",
      "She said the matter has been turned over to NASA's Office of Inspector General, adding that \"there is potential risk of the items being seized by the government until title issues have been resolved.\"\n",
      "Lovell, 83, who lives near Chicago and owns a restaurant bearing his name in Lake Forest, Ill., declined comment through a spokeswoman.\n",
      "In the Mitchell lawsuit, his attorney argued prior to the settlement that NASA officials told astronauts long ago they could keep certain equipment from the missions, and many such items wind up on auction house lists. A 1972 NASA memo seems to back up that claim, requiring only that the astronauts provide the agency with lists of items in their possession.\n",
      "Apollo 15 astronauts were reprimanded after they took unauthorized, special envelopes to the moon with stamps that were given a special postal marking shortly after their return in 1971. They had a deal with a German stamp dealer who later sold them for $1,500 each.\n",
      "Last month, the NASA inspector general reported that since 1970, more than 500 pieces of moon rocks, meteorites, comet chunks and other space material have been stolen or gone missing. The report said NASA needs to keep better track of some 26,000 samples sent to researchers and museums or the agency runs greater risk they will be lost.\n",

      "As we predicted last night, the fact that Mitt Romney addressed poor people in a rather business-like way is now a national issue.\n",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n",
      "MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm in this race because I care about Americans. I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs a repair I'll fix it. I'm not concerned about the very rich they are doing just fine. I'm concerned about the very heart of America the 90 percent, 95 percent of Americans who are right now are struggling.\n",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n",
      "O'REILLY: Well obviously the governor used a poor choice of words with the very poor and left is running wild with it. But so are some on the right.\n",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n",
      "GINGRICH: Well Governor Romney and President Obama seem to believe that a, quote, \"Safety net is all the poor needs\". I don't believe that. What the poor need is a trampoline so they can spring up and quit being poor.\n",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n",
      "O'REILLY: All right, let's take a look at poverty in America. Right now there are close to 50 million poor people in the U.S.A. Back in 1964 the poverty rate stood at 19 percent of the population. And so the great society programs were launched by President Lyndon Johnson. Since that time more than $16 trillion have been spent on welfare payments to the poor. And the Heritage Foundation estimates that over the next ten years, an additional $10 trillion will be spent.\n",
      "Yet the poverty rate is only down four points. So do the math; $16 trillion, four percentage point decline. Obviously welfare is not the trampoline Newt Gingrich is talking about.\n",
      "The dilemma for Governor Romney is this, he's a rich guy; he doesn't hang around with the folks. Contrast that image to President Obama who portrays himself as a community organizer, in tune with the street. Mr. Obama wants a massive federal intervention to redistribute income to the poor. That's what Obamacare is all about. That's what tax the rich is all about. Romney says, no, he wants the private sector to create jobs saying that will lead more people out of poverty.\n",
      "In the meantime, Romney says he'll keep the welfare safety net in place. The mistake the Governor is making is he's not dealing with the true causes of poverty thereby showing real concern for the impoverished. That's what all politicians should do and the causes are these: poor education, addiction, irresponsible behavior and laziness. That's right far-left people. Some folks are lazy.\n",
      "On the education front, America spends the highest amount per student in the world with the exception of Switzerland. So if the kids aren't learning it's likely because of terrible family situations or awful teachers, not money.\n",
      "Addiction, an estimated 10 percent of the American population is involved with substance abuse.\n",
      "And finally, irresponsible behavior; if you are a criminal and go to prison, you are going to have a hard time getting a good job. If you have a giant tattoo of a scorpion on your neck, IBM will not hire you. Personal choices can lead to prosperity or dereliction.\n",
      "There is usually a reason people are poor in a country that has more opportunity than any other place on earth. It almost always comes back to personal circumstances. And all the government in the world is not going to change that. And that's what Governor Romney should be talking about and that's what Barack Obama should be talking about and Newt Gingrich as well and everybody else.\n",

      "He had the look. He had the resume. He had the money. He had the beautiful family. By golly, he had the hair.\n",
      "But Jon Huntsman, despite the hype, never seemed to have the votes. And on Monday, he bailed out of the Republican presidential primary contest, trying to keep his dignity intact as he slammed his own party for going negative on one another.\n",
      "\"Rather than trying to advance our common goal, this race has degenerated into an onslaught of negative and personal attacks not worthy of the American people,\" Huntsman said. \"At its core the Republican Party is a party of ideas, but the current toxic form of our political discourse does not help our cause and is just one of the many reasons the American people has lost trust in their leaders. ...\n",
      "\"Today, I am suspending my campaign for the presidency. I believe it is now time for our party to unite around the candidate best equipped to defeat Barack Obama. Despite our differences and the space between us on some of the issues, I believe that candidate is Governor Mitt Romney,\" Huntsman said.\n",
      "Following a campaign kickoff that promised not hope, but \"answers,\" for America, the former U.S. ambassador to China came limping out of his firewall state of New Hampshire with a third-place \"ticket to ride\" to South Carolina.\n",
      "But his ability to gain traction in the first-in-the-South primary just wasn't there, and as the only remaining candidate who never enjoyed a surge, even a brief one, Huntsman decided to throw in the towel.\n",
      "That Huntsman never executed the enthusiasm from Republican primary voters speaks to a peculiarity surrounding his bid -- only rarely has there been such a wide gap between a presidential candidate's positive media coverage and his election performance.\n",
      "\"Were it not for the modern media fascination with him, he wouldn't even be invited to be on the stage at debates,\" GOP consultant Joe Brettell said.\n",
      "Officials and analysts say the buzz around Huntsman was rooted in several factors. Foremost, there was the novelty of a candidate running against his former boss. The story of one of President Obama's top ambassadors returning from his appointment/exile in China to challenge the incumbent was too titillating to resist.\n",
      "Then there was his pitch as the centrist, self-proclaimed \"sane Republican\" who openly tweaked his rivals for their positions.\n",
      "\"To be clear. I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy,\" he tweeted last August.\n",
      "Mocking the beliefs of a large chunk of the GOP primary base might not have been smart politics, but it was comforting to the editorial boards of some news organizations.\n",
      "For a candidate so far back in the polls, Huntsman received a considerable number of newspaper endorsements, including big ones from the Boston Globe and The State, which alternately called him \"bold,\" a \"realist\" and \"the best candidate to seize this moment in GOP history.\"\n",
      "The Globe liked Huntsman's criticism of those who \"reject evolution and the science behind global warming.\" The State, defining itself as the \"sensible center,\" said Huntsman \"isn't merely a partisan.\"\n",
      "The Concord Monitor expressed similar sentiments in its endorsement, describing the candidate as \"a consistent but never doctrinaire conservative.\"\n",
      "U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who worked as Huntsman's gubernatorial campaign manager and chief of staff when Huntsman was Utah governor, said Huntsman's centrist leanings were attractive to the media, as was \"his proximity to Barack Obama.\"\n",
      "\"The media seemed infatuated with him,\" he told FoxNews.com.\n",
      "But, Chaffetz said, despite Huntsman's truly conservative record, he did not have a \"natural base\" with the party.\n",
      "\"Mitt Romney built his over the course of years. Newt Gingrich is the former speaker of the House. Jon Huntsman just spent the last couple years working for Barack Obama in China,\" Chaffetz said. \"Probably not bumping into a lot of people from Manchester.\"\n",
      "From the time he entered, Huntsman earned attention across all spectrums of the media. The Wall Street Journal in September praised his economic plan as the best in the field. The National Review, which in December published a non-endorsement of Gingrich, cited Huntsman as one of three candidates -- along with Romney and Rick Santorum -- who showed promise.\n",
      "His campaign announcement, set to the backdrop of the Statue of Liberty just like Ronald Reagan's general election campaign kickoff in 1980, similarly garnered much attention. The Washington Post, in its write-up at the time, called Huntsman the \"biggest wild card in the 2012 field,\" one who could either surge or go belly up.\n",
      "Brettell said Huntsman benefited from a widespread media gamble of \"looking smart by picking a dark horse,\" but that the concentration of evangelicals and values voters in the early primary states -- like Iowa, which Huntsman skipped -- always loomed as a hurdle to his success.\n",
      "\"A lot of that early buzz was fueled by people trying to look like they were insiders,\" Brettell said. \"But the reality is the modern primary calendar didn't support the resume that Jon Huntsman brought to the table.\"\n",
      "Beyond the media buzz, Huntsman didn’t have much of a network of support. He had a few notable political names connected to the campaign, including the controversial former John McCain adviser John Weaver and pollster Whit Ayres.\n",
      "As with nearly every candidate, he had a PAC -- this one called Our Destiny PAC -- at his back, reportedly funded in part by his wealthy father. Campaign finance records crunched by the Center for Responsive Politics show he pulled in donations from Wall Street, the University of Utah and executives connected with Ultimate Fighting Championship.\n",
      "But he lacked big-name surrogates like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is backing Romney, on the campaign trail. His surrogates were most often members of his family, namely his telegenic daughters.\n",
      "Chaffetz, despite having worked for Huntsman, did not endorse him, though he described his former boss as \"very formidable in whatever he does.\" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, another home-state member of Congress who used to work for Huntsman, also did not endorse him. Neither did Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, who was Huntsman's lieutenant governor before Huntsman left to become ambassador to China.\n",
      "Despite not winning over the home team, as Utah governor, Huntsman cut the state sales tax, implemented a flat income tax and presided over some of the strongest job growth in the country. He led the company founded by his father. He served as ambassador to Singapore under President George H.W. Bush. While ambassador to China he was known for being tough on the country when it came to human rights.\n",
      "His profile contained a fair number of flourishes that could make the average voter look twice. He speaks Mandarin -- as he reminded voters when he used the language to tell off Romney at a debate. He rides a motorcycle. He's a rock-and-roll musician, playing a mean keyboard.\n",
      "But while he was conservative on issues like abortion, he wasn't on others -- he backed civil unions for gay couples and he supported caps on emissions, though he now says he doesn’t support a national cap-and-trade system.\n",
      "And his time with the Obama administration was undeniably a hurdle in the primaries.\n",
      "\"There was a lot of kind of fascination with the guy coming from all kinds of places, but not the place where the Republican Party is situated today,\" said Steffen Schmidt, political science professor at Iowa State University.\n",
      "Huntsman aggressively courted New Hampshire's storied independent voters but appeared to ignore the parts of the base that other candidates were scrambling for. He even openly mocked Iowa as a state that picks corn, not presidential candidates.\n",
      "Jane Aitken, co-founder of the New Hampshire Tea Party Coalition, said her group never got a response from Huntsman when they invited him -- and other candidates -- to a meeting.\n",
      "Huntsman's campaign did make its share of missteps from the very beginning. At his kickoff, press passes had an inaccurate spelling of the candidate's name. He set up his campaign headquarters in Florida, only to move it to New Hampshire.\n",
      "Schmidt said Huntsman might have been able to gain traction were it not for Ron Paul sucking away the libertarians and young voters in New Hampshire. Still, he said Huntsman lacked the vision to match the hype.\n",
      "\"You couldn't really identify any big plans with him,\" he said. \"What is Huntsman's big story? There isn't one.\"\n",

      "Jan. 8, 2012: Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow (15) celebrates after beating the Pittsburgh Steelers 29-23 in overtime of an NFL wild card playoff football game in Denver.CHRIS SCHNEIDER/AP\n",
      "One of the most storied NFL playoff teams ran into a rejuvenated Tim Tebow and the Denver Broncos.\n",
      "Sorry, Pittsburgh Steelers.\n",
      "The magic is back.\n",
      "Tebow connected with Demaryius Thomas on an electrifying 80-yard touchdown pass on the first play of overtime and the Broncos defeated the stunned Steelers 29-23 in the AFC wild-card game on Sunday. Wild doesn't begin to describe it. The play took 11 seconds and was the quickest ending to an overtime in NFL history.\n",
      "Thomas hauled in a high play-action pass at the Denver 38, stiff-armed Ike Taylor and then outraced Ryan Mundy to the end zone. Tebow, who looked as startled as everyone else, headed for his own end zone and knelt on one knee -- a gesture known far and wide these days as Tebowing. Then he pounded a fist in triumph and took a victory lap.\n",
      "Behind Tebow's 316 yards passing, the Broncos (9-8) are heading to New England for a second-round game against the top-seeded Patriots on Saturday night.\n",
      "The Steelers (12-5) lost despite Ben Roethlisberger rallying injury-depleted Pittsburgh from a two-touchdown halftime deficit with 10 points in the final 10 minutes.\n",
      "Pittsburgh called tails for the overtime coin toss, and it came up heads. Tebow, who engineered five fourth-quarter comebacks and three OT wins in the regular season, wasted no time in finding Thomas to end the game. Mundy was playing in place of Ryan Clark, the Steelers' leading tackler who sat this one out because of a blood condition that's exacerbated at altitude.\n",
      "Clark was one of several Steelers sidelined or injured. Pro Bowl center Maurkice Pouncey was out, replaced by Doug Legursky, who had a bad snap right before halftime that moved Pittsburgh out of field goal range.\n",
      "After Thomas raced down the Broncos sideline, sending the crowd, including Broncos executive vice president John Elway, into a frenzy at Sports Authority Field, which was rocking like the old Mile High Stadium back in the 1990s.\n",
      "And Elway, the architect of so many those magical moments at the old place, jumped for joy in his suite.\n",
      "The Patriots walloped the Broncos 41-23 last month, sending Tebow into a funk that included seven turnovers and a 40 percent completion clip -- and prompting Elway to implore him to \"pull the trigger\" in the playoffs.\n",
      "Did he ever.\n",
      "Tebow completed 10 of 21 passes but Thomas hauled in four of them for 204 yards after his top target, Eric Decker, was lost to a left knee injury on the first play of the second quarter when he was hit by linebacker James Harrison.\n",
      "Tebow also ran 10 times for 50 yards and capped his best day as a pro with the toss to Thomas.\n",
      "These two teams had played the first ever regular season overtime game on Sept. 22, 1974, in Denver. Now, they played the first non-sudden death playoff game in history. The new rules called for both teams to get the ball in the extra period providing there wasn't a touchdown by either the offense or defense.\n",
      "Tebow took care of that in a hurry.\n",
      "Making his first appearance in the playoffs after going 7-4 as Denver's starter, Tebow outdueled Roethlisberger, a two-time Super Bowl winner, who fell to 10-4 in the playoffs.\n",
      "The Broncos snapped a three-game losing streak that had many wondering if they were even worthy of their first playoff in six seasons, and it kept the Steelers from their 34th playoff win, which would have broken a tie with the Cowboys for the most ever.\n",
      "Tebow led Denver to 20 second-quarter points -- they had scored just 13 in the quarter in his 11 starts -- but a 20-6 halftime lead didn't last long.\n",
      "Receiver Mike Wallace had a 1-yard TD run, Shaun Suisham kicked a short field goal and Jerricho Cotchery grabbed a 31-yard TD pass with 3:48 left in regulation to tie it.\n",

      "In ‘Jane by Design’ on ABC Family, Jane (Erica Dasher) plays a high school student who accidentally lands a job as a clothing designer at a hip fashion house. Her boss, a high powered executive, is played by Andie MacDowell.\n",
      "The 53-year-old South Carolina native has had a long career, first as a model and then starring in such crowd pleasing flicks like, ‘Four Weddings and a Funeral’ and ‘Groundhog Day.’ But her most important role by far is that of mother to her three children, Rainey - who was Miss. Golden Globe this year, Sarah Margaret and Justin.\n",
      "Fox411: Describe your character.\n",
      "Andie MacDowell: I am the boss of this young girl who I don’t realize is in high school. I am very demanding and I would say an exaggerated character. A lot of times in the fashion business you can meet exaggerated characters, people are a little over the top, definitely not plain.\n",
      "Fox411: Did you meet a lot of over the top characters when you were a model?\n",
      "AM: I did! You know I meet them in this business as well. I’ve met many what I would call, not your average person.\n",
      "Fox411: Which is a more backstabbing business? Modeling or Hollywood?\n",
      "AM: Now that’s not a good question! How am I going to answer that? The world’s tough, it’s not just those businesses. Are you telling me the corporate world is not just like this? Do you think there aren’t people on Wall Street who don’t have anger issues? I think anytime you’re dealing with people that are under the demands that any industry can cause, you’re going to find whackos and I play a whacko.\n",
      "Fox411: You’re the oldest. Was the cast in awe of you?\n",
      "AM: I found not so much that they came to me for advice... it’s interesting because I don’t get this, I don’t feel this way, but they were initially intimidated by me. I could have used that but I didn’t. But it didn’t last.\n",
      "Fox411: Well they grew up watching you.\n",
      "AM: Yeah that’s what it was. Also I wasn’t on set that much so I think it took them a while to figure out I’m just a quirky, kind of offbeat person, not intimidating, let’s put it that way.\n",
      "Fox411: Your daughter Rainey was Miss Golden Globe.\n",
      "AM: I tried to discourage (from a career in show business) but it did not work. It’s not because I don’t think it’s a great job because I do, I love my work, but I think fame is the hard part. People don’t realize it, it’s a sacrifice, it truly is. Everyone thinks, well that’s what you get for the big bucks but there are other ways to get the big bucks without the fame, you could be a producer. But I get it completely because I’m an artist, that’s my art form. And I love the actual, physical work, the camaraderie, I like becoming someone else and so I get that she has that piece in her. Both of my daughters are artistic. My other daughter is modeling, she’s in Milan right now and she’s still in high school.\n",
      "Fox411: Wow!\n",
      "AM: I know. I have my hands full.\n",
      "Fox411: Do you still live in the South?\n",
      "AM: I’ve been living in North Carolina. Rainey’s was bugging me to act since junior high and I didn’t let her because I truly felt I wanted her to have a normal life. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to do the same thing with my other daughter. Anyway I raised them in North Carolina and now they’ve chosen to not have a normal life but that’s okay, that’s their choice.\n",
      "I do still live in North Carolina but I don’t know for how much longer because I’d rather be out here (in Los Angeles). Rainey is out here and my son is in Montana which is really close and as much as I love North Carolina, I miss my work and now I’m free. I don’t have kids anymore. That was a huge part of my life, the biggest part of my life, the most important part of my life. Without them I’d have no real true purpose.\n",
      "Fox411: You starred in ‘Sex, Lies and Videotape’ which was huge.\n",
      "AM: It changed the business. I saw Harvey Weinstein last night and I said, ‘Do you remember me?’ and he goes, ‘Yes! You gave me the movie that got me my start.’ It changed the way people looked at independent movies.\n",

      "As riots over the accidental improper disposal of the Koran led to seven deaths by Wednesday, two senior NATO military officials stressed that it was because of clandestine communications written into the Korans in the first place that a decision was made to have them destroyed by U.S. troops.\n",
      "Afghan detainees at Bagram Air Base wrote inside Korans as a method for passing messages to fellow detainees, defacing the holy books in a manner considered blasphemous within Islam, the officials said, speaking to Fox News exclusively.\n",
      "One official stressed that \"while this was the reason the books were removed from the library, we sincerely regret that they were not handed over to Afghan religious authorities for proper disposal and removal, which would have been the correct procedure.\"\n",
      "A second official said that local religious leaders who came to look at the damaged material as part of an investigation into the incident were \"shocked by what they saw.\"\n",
      "Pages of the Korans contained many handwritten messages and in some cases printed notes were found inside the books. This official described the messages as \"extremist\" in nature.\n",
      "The joint Afghan and NATO investigation will include photo evidence of these messages, this official said.\n",
      "NATO and International Security Assistance Force officials are not excusing themselves for burning the material. Leaders ranging from Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta to Commanding officer in Afghanistan Gen. John Allen and their spokespeople have all acknowledged a serious mistake in judgment.\n",
      "\"This incident was completely unintentional. Material was inadvertently given to troops for burning. The decision to burn this material had nothing to do with it being religious in nature or related to Islam. It was a mistake. It was an error,\" ISAF spokesman Brigadier Gen. Carsten Jacobson said Wednesday during a briefing with Pentagon reporters.\n",
      "Nevertheless, Afghans have continued to protest. More demonstrations occurred Wednesday both inside Kabul and outside Bagram Air Base. Jacobson said at one point on Tuesday protesters had to be fired on with rubber bullets to stop them from trying to enter the base. The U.S. embassy in Kabul was also shuttered and a statement released warning Americans to stay away from forming riots.\n",
      "All this began when Afghan employees working a night shift earlier this week at Bagram Air Base discovered U.S. troops burning religious materials. Jacobson said these locals stopped the burning, then removed some of the burned books and took them off base to show other members of the community.\n",
      "On Tuesday night, Allen issued a new directive requiring all coalition forces complete a training regiment on the proper handling of religious materials no later than March 3. According to Jacobson, the training will the identification of religious materials, their significance, and proper handling and storage.\n",

      "Doctors have started treating a new type of eating disorder and warn aggressive anti-obesity campaigns may be harmful to some healthy children.\n",
      "The phenomenon has been observed by the state of Victoria's, in Australia, three leading pediatric services, with doctors hospitalizing children who have lost up to a third of their body weight over a few months in an irrational desire to stay thin.\n",
      "Royal Children's Hospital chair of adolescent health Susan Sawyer said this eating disorder, affecting children at the upper end of the healthy weight range, was only starting to be documented.\n",
      "\"When you're older and overweight it's a very simple message that weight loss is good for you,\" Sawyer said.\n",
      "\"The difficulty with young people is that even if they are moderately overweight, they are still growing height-wise and are at risk of over-interpreting public health messages of 'low fat is good' to suggest that 'no fat is better.'\n",
      "\"For all intents and purposes, these adolescents have anorexia nervosa in terms of how unwell they are, the distorted body image and the amount of weight loss, but they are at a normal weight.\n",
      "\"This is very new.\"\n",
      "Austin Hospital's medical director of mental health, Richard Newton, said he believed some of the nine and 10-year-olds being treated were becoming ill from \"the panic\" created by anti-obesity campaigns.\n",
      "\"We need to be giving healthy weight messages that don't vilify fatness, but actually encourage health,\" Newton, an associate professor, explained.\n",
      "\"Some of the health messages we give create panic. We have to reassure young people that if they do have a weight problem, it doesn't mean that makes them a bad person.\n",
      "\"We need to encourage people to not just consider physical health, but emotional wellbeing as well.\"\n",

      "\"You know, I think Santorum has some presidential qualities, and I'm hoping that if it does come down to it, we'll see a Republican in the White House... and that it's Rick Santorum.\"\n",
      "Mustaine said he was supporting Santorum over the primary's delegate leader Mitt Romney because he was distrustful of the means by which the former Massachusetts governor created his immense wealth.\n",
      "\"I've got to tell you, I was floored the other day to see that Mitt Romney's five boys have a $100 million trust fund,\" Mustaine told the music website. \"Where does a guy make that much money? So there's some questions there.\"\n",
      "The platinum-selling recording artist said that he briefly supported the candidacy of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, but ultimately decided he did not have the gravitas to be the president of the world's most powerful country.\n",
      "\"And watching Newt Gingrich, I was pretty excited for a while, but now he's just gone back to being that person that everybody said he was -- that angry little man,\" the 50-year-old said. \"I still like him, but I don't think I'd vote for him.\"\n",
      "As for Ron Paul, Mustaine said he simply could not support some of the Texas congressman's most extreme views.\n",
      "Megadeth's lead vocalist said Paul will \"make total sense for a while, and then he'll say something so way out that it negates everything else.\"\n",
      "The rocker said that while he is now supporting Santorum, what he hopes for most in January 2013 is that Barack Obama will not be inaugurated for a second term.\n",
      "\"I can't bear to watch what's happened to our great country,\" Mustaine said. \"Everybody's got their head in the sand. Everybody in the industry is like, 'Oh, Obama's doing such a great job...' I don't think so. Not from what I see.\"\n",

      "John Glenn fever has taken hold of Cape Canaveral once again.\n",
      "Three days before the 50th anniversary of his historic flight, the first American to orbit the Earth addressed employees at Kennedy Space Center. The NASA auditorium was packed Friday with hundreds of workers, many of whom stood along the walls to see the space legend.\n",
      "The 90-year-old Glenn was joined on stage by Scott Carpenter, 86, the only other survivor of the original Mercury 7 astronauts.\n",
      "Glenn recalled how he and his fellow Mercury astronauts traveled to Cape Canaveral to watch a missile blast off. It was a night launch, and the rocket blew apart over their heads.\n",
      "\"That wasn't a very good confidence-builder for our first trip to the cape,\" Glenn said. Improvements were made, and Glenn said he gained confidence in his Mercury-Atlas rocket, a converted nuclear missile. Otherwise, he said he would not have climbed aboard.\n",
      "Glenn's Friendship 7 capsule circled Earth three times on Feb. 20, 1962. Carpenter followed aboard Aurora 7 on May 24, 1962.\n",
      "They were the third and fourth Americans to rocket into space. Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom flew short suborbital missions in 1961, the same year the Soviet Union launched two cosmonauts into orbit on separate shots.\n",
      "Glenn and his wife, Annie, who turned 92 on Friday, were on hand Thursday evening for the attempted liftoff of the newest of the Atlas rockets. Windy weather forced a scrub of the Navy satellite launch.\n",
      "Local TV reporters covering the Atlas V launch attempt talked more about Glenn than the countdown. The news media swarmed Kennedy again Friday for NASA's kickoff of a full weekend of anniversary festivities.\n",

      "'Baseball Wives' star Anna Benson keeps her enemies close, and her husband closer.\n",
      "In 2004, she shocked Howard Stern by announcing on his radio show that if her husband, Major League Baseball pitcher Kris Benson, ever cheated on her, she'd sleep with everyone on the Mets (her husband’s team at the time) from the owner right on down to the batboy.\n",
      "Almost a decade later, Benson still insists that her husband stay faithful, declaring that open marriages between athletes and their wives are largely a myth. “Normal people don’t do that – and we’re normal people,” Benson told Fox411. “I’m not going to be like, ‘Oh yeah, you can bang however many skanks you want.’ No girl I know would do that, and no baseball wife I know would have that kind of agreement with her husband.”\n",
      "Benson keeps things interesting in the bedroom to prevent her husband’s eye from wandering. “I think that being willing to try new stuff, like dress up, do your hair and make-up all crazy, play a role or whatever – that’s the best way to do it,” explained Benson. “Because guys are pigs.... So, if you’re a different girl all the time, then that keeps them at least mostly interested.”\n",
      "Indeed.\n",
      "Benson, who has been married to her husband for 12 years, says wedded life isn’t always bliss. “We’re always up and down. We’re actually down right down,” admitted Benson. “But marriage goes in waves. You’ve got to be patient. People bail and give up on their marriages way too early. They just don’t put the work and the effort into it. You’ve got to suck up your ego a lot of times, because that can be a big downfall.”\n",
      "The Bensons have even attended counseling sessions to help with their marriage. “We’ve had several significant points where it was either that or divorce, and we took the counseling route,” said Benson. “It works! The first appointment that you go to, if you get someone decent, you feel so much better. Like, you learn so quickly different ways of handling stuff, it’s not even funny. I want to see more people try that route. If you can’t afford a counselor, go to your priest – they’ll counsel you.”\n",
      "Despite her wild reputation, Benson claims to be just a good, old-fashion girl at heart. “I’m very traditional, believe it or not. Born and raised in the South,” she said. “My daughters are not allowed to date until they’re at least 16, and I’m going to make it 18 for the next one.”\n",
      "How does Momma Benson lay down the law? “I pay the f***ing bills, that’s how I do it,” she said of her no-nonsense parenting style. “You want to f***ing eat? I’m real hardcore. My kids better be scared of me. They don’t talk to me like I’m one of their friends. And their grades better not be less than a ‘B’– ever.”\n",
      "And if Benson has her way, her kids won’t be having premarital sex. “I don’t agree with it, because I had premarital sex, and I had a baby when I was 17 years old,” said Benson. “I think that you should wait for your partner.”\n",
      "While Benson keeps things in check at home, she can’t control what happens on the set of 'Baseball Wives.' She says you can expect more fireworks between her and another baseball wife before the season ends later this year on VH1. “There is one wife who turns out to be a complete back-stabber,” said Benson. “It’s one thing to jokingly say something about a person, but when you slander a person, it’s a completely different ball game – people get sued for that. I can’t get into it, but it’ll all come out on the show. At this point, I’m rather concerned for her, because I think she has some deeply personal issues going on. I wish her no malice, however – I just really would rather never hear her name again.”\n",
      "But when it comes to her enemies, Benson is nothing if not crafty. Recently, she bought the domain names cheriknoblauch.com and jordanalenz.com, two of her “Baseball Wives” costars. “Now, they redirect to my web site, annabenson.net,” laughs Benson. “They didn’t think to get ‘em before I did!”\n",
      "Because domain squatting is the best revenge.\n",

      "Jan. 2, 2012: Rick Santorum speaks during a campaign stop at the Rising Sun Cafe in Polk City, Iowa.AP\n",
      "Employing some of the toughest rhetoric to date, the Republican presidential candidates gave their closing arguments the day before the Iowa caucuses -- assailing President Obama as a \"fraud\" who is \"dangerous\" to the country while holding nothing back in their criticism of the rest of the GOP field.\n",
      "The intensity of Monday's campaign trail sparring reflected the tension and uncertainty in the race.\n",
      "No fewer than three candidates are in contention for the top spot and many Iowans are undecided, in one of the most volatile GOP campaigns in history. Those on the leaderboard also represent distinct wings of the Republican Party, making the contest as much a statement about the ideological direction of the GOP -- in Iowa, anyway -- as a ruling on which candidates should advance to the next round.\n",
      "Despite Iowa's mixed record of picking winners, caucus-goers got the sense in the final hours that the candidates believe they have a lot riding on the results.\n",
      "Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator who suddenly is surging in the polls, charged into the final stretch with the message that he represents something his opponents do not -- electability and conservative principles.\n",
      "\"I'm asking you to not settle for someone as your nominee who might be able to win the election, but the election would be a pyrrhic victory,\" Santorum said Monday in Polk City. \"In other words, we wouldn't have a candidate who is going to be elected president who will do what's necessary of what America needs.\"\n",
      "The comment was an apparent swipe at Mitt Romney, whom Santorum also challenged over his private-sector credentials. \"We are not looking for a chief executive officer for this country. We're looking for a commander-in-chief,\" Santorum said.\n",
      "Santorum went on to question whether candidates like Romney and Rick Perry could put together a coalition in a general election against Obama -- though similar questions have been raised about Santorum.\n",
      "Going into the caucuses, the polls generally show Romney at the front of the GOP field, with Ron Paul and Santorum right behind him -- though a Public Policy Polling survey Monday showed Paul leading by 1 point.\n",
      "While Santorum represents the social conservative wing of the party, Paul and Romney align more with the libertarian and fiscal conservative wings, respectively.\n",
      "Paul, whose hands-off approach to foreign policy has come under attack as naïve, sprayed his opponents at a rally in Des Moines.\n",
      "\"Believe me, you don't have to worry about the choice if you choose another candidate, because the others represent the status quo,\" Paul said. \"But they're not talking about a foreign policy to defend America. They're talking about mischief around the world and policing the world. ... They don't care about your personal liberty, or it wouldn't be continuously undermined.\" +\n",
      "However, Paul later conceded that his path to the Republican nomination is uncertain.\n",
      "When asked Monday during an ABC News interview whether he sees himself in the Oval Office, Paul replied: \"Not really, but I think it's a possibility.\"\n",
      "He added: \"I don't deceive myself. You know what the odds are. The odds have been slim.\"\n",
      "Romney refrained from targeting his primary opponents, keeping his message focused on the sitting president and his own economic vision for America. At one point, he described Obama's presidency as \"just a detour, not our destiny.\"\n",
      "Arguably the toughest criticism Monday came from the two middle-tier candidates fighting to break into a top-three finish in Iowa.\n",
      "Perry, during a stop in Sioux City, accused Obama of sending the country on a path toward \"bankruptcy.\"\n",
      "\"He truly believes if you print enough money that you will create jobs. And we will expose him for the fraud that he is every day,\" Perry said.\n",
      "He balanced his criticism of Obama with shots at Paul and Santorum.\n",
      "Perry predicted that if Paul wins the White House, \"he will bring all of our troops back home, he'll bring the 5th Fleet back out of the Persian Gulf. And we will be living in the 1930's again.\"\n",
      "On the stump and in a new online ad, Perry targeted Santorum's record of pursuing earmarks as a member of the U.S. Senate.\n",
      "The online ad called Santorum \"a porker's best friend\" and ended with one word: \"Unelectable.\"\n",
      "Newt Gingrich, meanwhile, was in rare form. At one point, he conceded he does not think he's going to win Iowa, chalking up the rough odds to the glut of negative ads against him.\n",
      "But the ex-House speaker touted his ability to compete nationally, saying any other candidate would be \"an amateur in the Obama tradition.\"\n",
      "He directly challenged Romney's on-again, off-again status as the race's frontrunner.\n",
      "\"Romney is proving decisively that the moderate vote is about 23 percent,\" Gingrich said. \"He'll do somewhat better in the northeast and have one or two states where he does pretty well. But I think people who describe him as the frontrunner have to ask yourself the question -- if you spend that many million dollars to get to 23 percent, how could you possibly think he's the most electable candidate?\"\n",
      "Gingrich spent much of the day assailing the Obama administration, particularly over his aides' plan to base the president's early 2012 strategy on a contrast with Congress.\n",
      "Gingrich accused the president of planning to govern without Congress, calling it \"totally unconstitutional.\"\n",
      "Santorum also took his shots at Obama, calling him the most \"dangerous president since Jimmy Carter\" when it comes to foreign policy.\n",
      "Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad told Fox News that Santorum, who rose rapidly from only single digits in the polls, \"did it the old-fashioned way\" -- by traveling to every county in the state while other candidates were splitting their time.\n",
      "\"I think he will be one of the top three,\" Branstad said.\n",
      "Michele Bachmann, who is trailing in Iowa despite winning the Ames Straw Poll over the summer, was out with a new TV ad in Iowa Monday in a last-ditch attempt to win back supporters. The ad stressed her Iowa roots and described her as a \"consistent conservative fighter.\"\n",
      "Out of the Iowa contest, the candidates head next into New Hampshire for the first-in-the-nation primary, and then South Carolina. Romney has dominated New Hampshire, though Santorum and others claim they will compete there. Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, who is not campaigning in Iowa and is behind in the polls, has also staked his campaign on New Hampshire.\n",

      "Sharapova routed Silvia Soler-Espinosa 6-2, 6-1. Kuznetsova then downed Carla Suarez Navarro 6-3, 6-1.\n",
      "After an early exchange of breaks, Sharapova won four consecutive games in the first set and four more in the second. She closed the match on her first match point with a forehand that Fed Cup rookie Soler-Espinosa failed to return.\n",
      "\"I was a bit nervous before the beginning of the match as I failed to show my best tennis in my previous Fed Cup appearance in Moscow,\" Sharapova said.\n",
      "Sharapova is playing for Russia for the third time. The three-time Grand Slam champion won both her singles matches against Israel in 2008. She lost in opening singles against France last year.\n",
      "\"It was very important to stay concentrated, to believe and prove that my tennis is better and to win the match,\" shed said. \"Luckily, I managed to do all that and now I'm really satisfied with my performance.\"\n",
      "Russia has won the Fed Cup title four times since 2004 and is 5-1 against Spain, which won the title five times between 1991 and 1998. The series winner will play Belgium or Serbia in the semifinals on April 21-22.\n",
      "Kuznetsova won four consecutive games before Suarez Navarro narrowed the gap to 4-3 in the first set. But the two-time major winner won five more games in a row to take a 3-0 lead in the second set. She converted her second match point with a service winner.\n",
      "\"From the scoreline, the match looked easy but in fact it was a bit difficult,\" Kuznetsova said. \"But I've played rather well today and I'm satisfied with my tennis.\"\n",

      "The Obama administration opened the door slightly Tuesday to international military assistance for Syria's rebels, with officials saying new tactics may have to be explored if President Bashar Assad continues to defy pressure to halt a brutal crackdown on dissenters.\n",
      "In coordinated messages, the White House and State Department said they still hope for a political solution. But faced with the daily onslaught by the Assad regime against Syrian civilians, officials dropped the administration's previous strident opposition to arming anti-regime forces. It remained unclear, though, what, if any, role the U.S. might play in providing such aid.\n",
      "\"We don't want to take actions that would contribute to the further militarization of Syria because that could take the country down a dangerous path,\" White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters. \"But we don't rule out additional measures if the international community should wait too long and not take the kind of action that needs to be taken.\"\n",
      "The administration has previously said flatly that more weapons are not the answer to the Syrian situation. There had been no mention of \"additional measures.\"\n",
      "At the State Department, spokeswoman Victoria Nuland used nearly identical language to describe the administration's evolving position.\n",
      "\"From our perspective, we don't believe that it makes sense to contribute now to the further militarization of Syria,\" she told reporters. \"What we don't want to see is the spiral of violence increase. That said, if we can't get Assad to yield to the pressure that we are all bringing to bear, we may have to consider additional measures.\"\n",
      "Neither Carney nor Nuland would elaborate on what \"additional measures\" might be taken but there have been growing calls, including from some in Congress, for the international community to arm the rebels. Most suggestions to that effect have foreseen Arab nations such as Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia -- and not the West -- possibly providing military assistance.\n",
      "Other officials said discussions are now under way about adding a military component to a package of humanitarian and political aid to the opposition that's to be discussed at a major international conference on Syria this week in Tunisia.\n",
      "More than 70 countries have been invited to meet Friday in Tunisia for a \"Friends of Syria\" meeting. The meeting follows the failure of the UN Security Council to endorse an Arab plan that would have seen Assad removed from power.\n",
      "The meeting of the \"Friends of Syria\" in Tunis is not likely to produce decisions on military aid or even recognition of Syria's disparate opposition groups, according to U.S. officials. But countries are considering creating large stockpiles of humanitarian aid along Syria's borders, the officials said.\n",
      "U.S. officials stressed that discussion of military assistance is still preliminary. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the diplomacy. To maintain the pressure against Assad, Washington is trying to keep as many countries as possible involved in the international coordination against Syria's government -- even if there is no consensus strategy on arming the rebels.\n",
      "This week's talks will seek to clarify some of the confusion. The U.S. is trying to get a clearer picture of what promises countries such as Syria's Arab neighbors are making to elements of the opposition; which rebels each government might support; and some agreement on what types of assistance would be helpful or damaging.\n",
      "The backdrop to the discussions is the increasing fear that Syria could descend into an all-out civil war.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Pentagon on Tuesday disputed reports that Iranian ships docked at a Syrian port over the weekend.\n",

      "Serious injuries involving pedestrians wearing headphones have more than tripled since 2004, a U.S. study showed.\n",
      "Researchers from the University of Maryland found that people often were hit by vehicles because their music blocked out horns or sirens alerting them to danger.\n",
      "In 70 percent of cases, the headphone-wearing pedestrians died as a result of the injuries they sustained from being hit by traffic.\n",
      "The researchers studied the data of 116 accidents involving pedestrians wearing headphones between 2004 and 2011. The number of incidents rose from 16 in 2004 to 47 in 2011.\n",

      "The Obama administration, reeling from the biggest classified information breach in U.S. history thanks to WikiLeaks and its conspirators, is cracking down on intelligence leaks with unprecedented vigor.\n",
      "But open government groups and watchdogs are raising alarm, claiming the administration is taking a heavy-handed approach that could \"chill\" whistle-blowers and those who cover their claims.\n",
      "The groups are not necessarily leaping to the defense of Bradley Manning, the accused WikiLeaker. Rather, they're concerned about the sheer number of Americans who have been charged under the Espionage Act over the past few years.\n",
      "Since 2009, six Americans accused of leaking sensitive information -- including Manning -- have been charged under the act. The act has been used to charge accused media leakers more times in the last few years than during the rest of the law's decades-long history, according to the Project on Government Oversight.\n",
      "\"They're using a hammer to go after these folks,\" said Joe Newman, spokesman with the Project on Government Oversight.\n",
      "The concern is that, while the defendants in these cases may or may not have leaked classified material, the government is using an intimidating tool to punish them. The World War I-era Espionage Act was famously used to charge the Rosenbergs, American communists, for allegedly passing secret information to the Soviet Union -- they were executed for the offense.\n",
      "Watchdog groups claim being charged under the act is tantamount to being branded a \"traitor.\"\n",
      "The Justice Department rejects this argument, noting that the act has many provisions -- notably, disclosure of classified information and of defense information, which is not by itself an espionage charge.\n",
      "\"None of these individuals has been charged with spying for a foreign government,\" Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said.\n",
      "But Ed MacMahon, the defense attorney for a former CIA agent who was indicted and accused of illegally disclosing sensitive information in late 2010, said he thinks the government is using the act to intimidate leakers.\n",
      "He said being charged under the Espionage Act \"sounds a lot worse than disclosure of classified information,\" but he challenged whether the law should apply.\n",
      "\"I don't believe that it's the intent of the Espionage Act to deal with supposed leaks between journalists and people inside of government. I think it has to do with aiding the enemy,\" he said.\n",
      "Jesselyn Radack, director of national security and human rights for the Government Accountability Project, also said the law is \"meant to go after spies, not whistle-blowers.\"\n",
      "\"I'm not saying whistle-blowers have carte blanche or should have carte blanche to divulge anything they want,\" she said. But Radack said they should be \"punished appropriately.\"\n",
      "She said the prosecutions will have the effect of chilling coverage. \"We're back to the good old days of underground parking garages,\" she said.\n",
      "The most recent case brought by the government is that of former CIA officer John Kiriakou. Charged last month, he was accused of leaking sensitive information about two other CIA officers to reporters. According to prosecutors, Kiriakou revealed the names of both officers and disclosed information about their involvement in the interrogation of terror suspects.\n",
      "In a written statement, the Justice Department said the Kiriakou case does not pertain to \"whistle-blowing\" -- but rather, the disclosure of CIA officer identities.\n",
      "The department said it \"does not target whistle-blowers\" and has a system for federal employees to report wrongdoing.\n",
      "\"However, we cannot sanction or condone federal employees who knowingly and willfully disclose classified information to the media or others not entitled to receive such information,\" the statement said.\n",
      "In another case, former CIA agent Jeffrey Sterling was accused of disclosing information to a reporter about covert activities to undermine another country's weapons program. Though the government was vague about the details, The New York Times reported that the prosecutors believe Sterling was talking to one of that newspaper's reporters as he was writing about efforts to disrupt Iran's nuclear program. Sterling, who is represented by MacMahon, has pleaded not guilty, and the case is on appeal.\n",
      "The four other cases span the gamut. In one, a former National Security Agency employee was accused of leaking sensitive information -- Newman claimed the individual, Thomas Drake, was blowing the whistle on \"waste and mismanagement\" in the agency. Drake later pleaded down to a lower misdemeanor offense.\n",
      "White House Press Secretary Jay Carney was asked about these cases earlier this week, challenged on the transparency topic as the administration praised journalists who have been trying to cover the conflict in Syria.\n",
      "\"I think that there are issues here that involve highly sensitive classified information, and I think that ... divulging that kind of information is a serious issue and always has been,\" Carney said.\n",
      "Carney, while praising the \"bravery of reporters\" who put themselves in harm's way abroad, said he would not comment specifically about the alleged leak cases.\n",
      "Newman said he believes the Obama administration is spooked by the WikiLeaks case and is using the Espionage Act to send a message to other employees to \"button it up\" -- though some of these cases pre-date the Manning case.\n",
      "He acknowledged that the six defendants are not \"apples to apples,\" clarifying that the Project on Government Oversight \"doesn't necessarily condone\" what Manning did. But for others, he questioned whether the information they leaked was being overlooked in the rush to punish.\n",
      "\"The knee-jerk reaction is to go after the whistle-blower first and really not be concerned with what they might be telling us,\" he said.\n",

      "Living in a crowded city or near a busy highway may be tied to a higher chance of having a stroke or losing your memory, new research suggests.\n",
      "A study published Monday in the Archives of Internal Medicine found a higher risk of stroke after \"moderate\" compared to \"good\" air quality days in Boston-area residents, especially when traffic-related pollution was high.\n",
      "And another report in the same journal documented a faster long-term decline in thinking and memory skills in women living in higher-pollution areas of the United States.\n",
      "\"One of the important points is that at levels that are considered to be generally safe by the U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), we're seeing important health effects,\" said Gregory Wellenius, the lead author of the stroke study from Brown University in Providence.\n",
      "\"Individuals that may be susceptible to air pollution health effects may consider staying inside during high air pollution levels,\" Wellenius told Reuters Health.\n",
      "He and his colleagues reviewed the medical records of about 1,700 patients who were admitted to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston with a stroke between 1999 and 2008.\n",
      "Using data from a local air pollution monitoring station, the team found that the risk of having a stroke was 34 percent higher in the 24 hours after \"moderate\" EPA pollution readings compared to \"good\" pollution days. That increased risk was greatest within 12 to 14 hours of pollution exposure, and was linked to nitrogen dioxide, a traffic-related pollutant.\n",
      "Wellenius said that blood vessels dilate and constrict in response to the outside environment in an attempt to keep blood pressure constant. But air pollution might affect the body's ability to regulate blood pressure, he added, which might trigger a stroke in people who are already at risk.\n",
      "That same effect could explain why over a longer period of time, being exposed to air pollution might be associated with declining thinking and memory skills.\n",
      "\"The blood flow to the brain is incredibly important for cognitive function,\" Wellenius said. \"There may be effects... on blood flow to the brain that we're not yet aware of that could be affecting cognitive function.\"\n",
      "A faster decline\n",
      "In the other study, researchers led by Jennifer Weuve of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago analyzed a series of cognitive tests given to close to 20,000 women, mostly in their 70s, and also estimated the air pollution around their homes through the EPA's monitoring system.\n",
      "They found that more air pollution was tied to faster rates of cognitive decline. For two different sizes of pollution particles, the difference in thinking and memory skills between women with some of the highest and lowest exposures was similar to a year or two of age-related decline, Weuve's team reported.\n",
      "That's probably not a mental change an individual person would notice, Weuve told Reuters Health. But on a population-wide scale, cleaner air might mean fewer people in the U.S. are diagnosed with dementia.\n",
      "Researchers have \"speculated whether the damage of exposure to ambient air pollution may also reach the human brain,\" said Dr. Jiu-Chiuan Chen, an environmental health researcher at the of University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, who was not involved in either study.\n",
      "He said the new cognition findings, because they're preliminary, shouldn't cause women to be too concerned -- but they should encourage future research into the effects of pollution on thinking and memory.\n",
      "In a separate research letter also published with the studies, exposure to pollutants in secondhand smoke was found to be linked to a 39 percent higher risk of dementia in Chinese women.\n",
      "Time to adjust standards?\n",
      "None of the findings can prove that pollutants, themselves, are to blame for memory problems or strokes. But previous studies support negative effects on the heart and blood vessels.\n",
      "While there are ways that people can limit their exposure to air pollution, researchers said that for widespread health benefits, the EPA might have to reconsider acceptable upper limits for pollutants.\n",
      "\"I think this is really a public health problem\" with regard to stroke risk in particular, Chen told Reuters Health. \"The policymakers need to realize this real threat to human health.\"\n",
      "\"Our air is of the quality where people are generally not keeling over dead because it's so bad,\" Weuve said.\n",
      "\"We've made a lot of progress in reducing ambient air pollution, however the reductions haven't been the same everywhere... and we're still (seeing) health effects, even at the current levels of exposure.\"\n",

      "Former police officer Chris Willden didn't hesitate when he realized children were trapped in an upside down car in an icy Utah river. He pulled his handgun, pushed it up against the submerged windows and shot out the glass.\n",
      "Then he reached inside.\n",
      "\"I was trying to grab arms, but I couldn't feel anything,\" Willden said. \"I'm thinking ... what are we going to do?\"'\n",
      "But he turned to see up to eight other passers-by had scrambled down the embankment to help after coming upon the accident along U.S. 89 in Logan Canyon on Saturday afternoon.\n",
      "Highway Patrol Lt. Steve Winward said that after shooting out a window, the rescuer cut a seatbelt to free one child. He said the rescuers helped turn the Honda Accord upright in the Logan River.\n",
      "They lifted the Honda Accord enough to free the three trapped children.\n",
      "The driver, Roger Andersen, 46, of Logan, had lost control of the car as he tried to brake while heading northbound in slippery conditions. His 9-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son were trapped along with a second 9-year-old girl.\n",
      "\"(The driver) was panicked, doing everything he could to get in through the doors, but they wouldn't budge,\" said Willden, who had jumped into the water with his own father.\n",
      "\"I remember thinking to myself, `You're going to see some dead kids, get ready. I've got three of my own and it was going to be (an awful) start to the New Year.\"\n",
      "Willden, who jumped into the water with his father, said he tried unsuccessfully to open windows and doors. He then used his firearm just as he had done in training for his current job as a bodyguard and Department of Defense contractor.\n",
      "One of the girls had found an air pocket and was breathing fine but was trapped in her seat belt. Willden cut it with a pocket knife and pulled her from the rear passenger window.\n",
      "He said the other two children were lifeless, the boy upside down in his car seat and the second girl floating in the front passenger compartment. Both were pulled from the vehicle.\n",
      "Buzzy Mullahkel of North Logan told the Deseret News of Salt Lake City that the boy wasn't breathing and didn't have a pulse but was revived when another passer-by performed CPR.\n",
      "\"Emotions started taking over when he started to breathe. Everybody started to cheer. Lots of tears and clapping,\" said Mullahkel, a father of a 4-year-old.\n",
      "Willden, 35 of Ogden, was wrapping up his bleeding forearms cut by the broken window when he heard cheers.\n",
      "\"That was awesome,\" he said. \"I knew that's where the little boy was.\"\n",
      "He would later learn both the boy and his sister, who were flown by air ambulance to Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City, had survived.\n",
      "Bonnie Midget, a hospital spokeswoman, said Sunday both are doing well after spending the night in intensive care. They were taken out of intensive care Sunday but still in the hospital, listed in fair condition as they recover from hypothermia.\n",

      "Half of teen mothers say they were not using birth control when they got pregnant, and a new report outlines the reasons teens give for not doing so.\n",
      "Of teen moms who reported not using birth control, 31 percent said they did not believe they could get pregnant at the time. To decrease teen birth rates, teens need factual information about the conditions under which pregnancy can occur, along with public health efforts aimed at reducing or delaying teens' sexual activities, according to the report released today by researchers for the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention.\n",
      "Others gave various reasons for not using birth control — 24 percent said their partner did not want to use contraception, 13 percent said they had trouble getting birth control, 9 percent said they experienced side effects from using contraception and 8 percent said they thought their sex partner was sterile. Twenty-two percent of the teens said they did not mind getting pregnant.\n",
      "Health care providers and parents can work to prevent teen pregnancy by increasing teens' motivation to avoid pregnancy; providing access to contraception and encouraging the use of more effective methods, and strengthening the skills of teens to negotiate contraceptive use with their partners.\n",
      "Some teen moms reported using birth control\n",
      "Of all teens who gave birth, 21 percent reported using a highly effective contraceptive method, such as an intrauterine device, and an additional 24 percent reported used condoms. Inconsistent use of contraception may explain how these teens became pregnant, according to the report.\n",
      "Research has shown that teens who report using birth control do not use it consistently, the report noted. One survey found that among sexually active teens who reported using condoms, only 52 percent said they used a condom every time they had sex.\n",
      "The rates of not using birth control did not vary among teens of different racial groups — whether white, black or Hispanic, about half the teens reported not using birth control when they became pregnant.\n",
      "There were some differences among the groups in terms of the reasons teens gave for not using birth control. Forty-two percent of Hispanic teens reported not using contraception because they did not think they could get pregnant at the time, whereas 32 percent of black teens gave that reason and 27 percent of white teens did.\n",

      "The researchers used data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, which gathers data on maternal attitudes and experiences before, during and after pregnancy. Thirty-seven states and New York City contribute data to the system. The data used in the report were gathered from 2004 to 2008.\n",

      "A source told ESPN the situation \"is not a safety issue,\" but a question of the four-time MVP's performance level.\n",

      "The Badgers had no answer for Sullinger early on. He scored the Buckeyes' first nine points, consistently getting the best of the player assigned to defend him, Jared Berggren. Sullinger finished the first half with 16 points.\n",
      "Wisconsin stayed in the game despite going 2 for 14 from 3-point range in the first half.\n",
      "Sullinger had a tougher time to start the second half, taking an elbow to the face from Berggren on the defensive end and later missing an easy layup after he'd badly beaten a defender on the baseline.\n",

      "Gabriel Landeskog, Milan Hejduk and Paul Stastny also scored for Colorado. The Avalanche have won two in a row since snapping a five-game skid.\n",
      "The Hurricanes got goals from Tim Brent, Jiri Tlusty and Eric Staal in a city that keeps haunting them. The Carolina franchise hasn't won in Denver since Feb. 9, 1996, when the team was the Hartford Whalers.\n",
      "On his winner, O'Reilly stole the puck from Justin Faulk at center ice, skated in on the left side and sent a slap shot through the legs of Cam Ward. O'Reilly raised his arms in the air as he cast a quick glance at the scoreboard to see if he got the shot off in time.\n",
      "He did as the clock displayed 1.2 seconds remaining.\n",

      "Giguere, who was brought in to serve as a mentor to the younger Semyon Varlamov, has played so well that it's been hard to get him out of the goal. He's among the NHL leaders in goals-against and save percentage.\n",
      "The 34-year-old Giguere faced the franchise that drafted him with the 13th overall in 1995. He played eight games for the organization in 1996-97, going 1-4 with a 3.65 goals-against average.\n",
      "Ward was just as splendid in net, robbing O'Reilly of a goal late in the game when Ward stuck out his pad as the Avalanche forward cruised in on a breakaway.\n",
      "Hejduk tied the game at 2 early in the second period on a rush that he started up the ice. Hejduk passed the puck to Jones on the left wing, who quickly sent it all the way over to Stastny on the right side. Stastny patiently waited for Hejduk to slip past the defender and then hit the Colorado captain in stride for the tap-in goal.\n",
      "The goal snapped a five-game drought for Hejduk. His new line with Stastny and Jones has each of them hitting on all cylinders. The trio has accounted for 11 points over the last two games.\n",
      "After Staal gave the Hurricanes back the lead in the second period with his 14th goal of the season, Stastny answered right back in the final minute.\n",
      "Carolina came out flying in the first period and scored when Anthony Stewart delivered a backhand pass to Brent, who drilled a shot past Giguere after working free in front of the net.\n",
      "It looked as if the period might finish that way, but there was a late flurry of scoring.\n",
      "First, Landeskog made the Hurricanes pay for a turnover in their end when he corralled the loose puck and slid a shot by Ward.\n",
      "Just 31 seconds later, Carolina recaptured the lead after Tlusty sent a wrist shot through the skates of Avs defenseman Jan Hejda and beat Giguere, who appeared screened on the play.\n",

      "That opening 10-0 run, however, was quickly forgotten when San Diego State matched it with a 12-2 surge, then added a 15-0 run in the second half that pushed the Aztecs to a 75-70 victory Wednesday night.\n",
      "\"Then we got complacent,\" Alford said about the Lobos' effort. \"I thought we got softer as the game got going instead of tougher as the game got going and that was the frustrating part.\"\n",
      "New Mexico (15-3, 1-1 Mountain West) couldn't hold off Xavier Thames, who scored 22 points for the Aztecs (16-2, 2-0).\n",
      "\"It was a tough game for us,\" Alford said. \"I give San Diego State a lot of credit. They are a very good basketball team.\"\n",
      "Thames knew what the Aztecs had to do get back in the Mountain West game — and quiet the rocking crowd.\n",
      "\"We just had to stick together,\" Thames said.\n",
      "The Aztecs won their ninth straight game and ended New Mexico's winning streak at 13 games.\n",
      "Thames provided the spark in his third game back after a knee injury.\n",
      "\"He played like Xavier Thames before he got hurt,\" Aztecs coach Steve Fisher said about the Washington State transfer who combined to go 2 for 13 with nearly as many turnovers as points in the first two games back.\n",
      "This time, he was 7 for 11 with four assists and just one turnover.\n",
      "Thames had help from Chase Tapley and Jamaal Franklin, who each scored 12 points.\n",
      "The Lobos got 20 points off the bench from Phillip McDonald, who went 6 for 9 on 3-pointers. But his teammates combined to go 7 of 22 from behind the arc.\n",
      "Tapley's 3-pointer with 2:41 left in the first half gave San Diego State its first lead at 28-27. The Aztecs took control midway through the second half behind a 15-0 run, turning a 48-44 deficit into a 59-48 advantage.\n",
      "\"We always talk about how we have to have three 8-0 or more runs per game and none for our opponents,\" Fisher said. \"We got it to 8-0, 10-0, and they kept talking, 'Don't let up. Don't give up the easy basket.' (New Mexico) did miss some easy shots in that stretch and we took advantage.\"\n",
      "The run included two 3-pointers from Franklin and one from LaBradford Franklin. San Diego State pushed the advantage to 64-51, before the Lobos tried to rally late behind McDonald's late 3-pointers.\n",
      "New Mexico controlled the glass, holding a 42-34 edge, including 21-10 on the offensive end, but it could only turn that into 23 second-chance points.\n",
      "\"One thing that works against us is our inability to rebound the ball,\" Fisher said. \"We gave up 40 rebounds and you can't do that.\"\n",
      "That wasn't enough to overcome San Diego State's better shooting effort from the field, where it went 27 for 56.\n",
      "\"We're a good team,\" Fisher said. \"We have to do it a different way. We're not going to overpower you. But we're going to fight all the way. We're going to make good decisions. We're going to shoot the ball and take care of the ball.\"\n",
      "It didn't help New Mexico's cause that leading scorer Tony Snell, didn't score until hitting a 3-pointer with 30 seconds left. He was 1 for 6 from the field, with all the attempts coming on 3-pointers.\n",

      "Daniel Radcliffe most likely had hundreds of film offers to choose from post-\"Harry Potter.\" His popularity and star power could have landed him in anything he wanted, yet he chose “The Woman In Black,” a disappointingly weak and underwhelming haunted house movie.\n",
      "Scene after endless scene of Radcliffe roaming the hallways of a spooky gothic house seeking the source of creepy noises and phantasmic movements is not compelling enough for a two-hour film. The Hogwarts alum spends the majority of the film opening and closing doors, looking behind curtains and peering into the shadows. He’s a bit slow in picking up that if there wasn’t anything there the first time, it’s probably not there the twentieth.\n",
      "The semblance of plot is as follows: Radcliffe is young lawyer Arthur Kipps who travels to a remote village seemingly out of an old Hammer Horror film (Hammer produced this film, too) to do something with some papers that really aren’t at all important so that his company can sell a big old scary house that nobody would ever want. (There’s more than mold to worry about) The villagers hate the outsider (of course they do) because as soon as young Arthur arrives, all their children start dying. Ghosts of the children appear, as does the titular character, who makes staying in the house as unpleasant and worrisome as, oh, sitting at a traffic light too long.\n",
      "“The Woman in Black” has so much potential to be a stellar and original horror film, if only there was a strong story to go with the visuals. Unfortunately, director James Watkins spends more time with stingers and cheap scares than caring about his protagonist or any overarching cinematic point.\n",
      "The film has an excellent supporting cast with Ciarán Hinds and Janet McTeer, but like Radcliffe, they have little to do but alter facial expressions from grimace to doubt to shock. The set design and music, however, are perfect. The house is appropriately vintage and eerie, filled with startling nicknacks and impressive architecture, while the moorish landscape is gorgeously threatening. Marco Beltrami’s almost black and white sounding score provides all the essential chills missing from the script.\n",

      "\"I think just being on a team and just having some adrenaline just gives me even more energy, to be honest,\" she said at a news conference Wednesday. \"I need to be on a team every week and not at home.\"\n",
      "Williams has had to learn the difference between recovering from an injury and an illness. That has meant pacing herself more in practice and minding doctors' orders not to push it while she tries to regain her form. The former world No. 1 and seven-time Grand Slam singles winner, Williams isn't used to taking it easy.\n",
      "\"The difference is acceptance — trying to accept how you feel and limitations. Listening to your body and taking care of yourself,\" she said. \"Instead of trying to run through a wall, just really kind of take a step back and be smart. I think that's kind of what I've learned.\"\n",

      "\"Just to have her around is such a big motivator for the rest of the team. There's a lot of excitement. I think Venus was thrilled and she was itching to get out there and hit that first ball,\" Fernandez said. \"I think that goes such a long way.

      "There are many different ways to fight depression – light being one of them. It has been shown that sunlight raises serotonin levels, which make you feel good. During 8 weeks of a Canadian study with 100 seasonal affective disorder patients, it showed that light therapy, in comparison to an anti-depressant, had equal improvement with the patients.\n",

      "Despite all the smarts built into them, smartphones have one fatal flaw: They can’t get wet. Yet.\n",
      "Three start-ups aim to correct that this year, offering special, micro-thin coatings made of nanomaterials that can seamlessly and invisibly encase your next iPhone or Android phone and keep it safe from the rain -- or even a plunge in the potty.\n",
      "HzO, P2i, and Liquipel are putting their technology on display this week at the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where the world’s gadget makers unveil the latest and greatest goodies that will fill your pockets in the upcoming year. And that’s in the rain or out, explains Paul Clayson, president and CEO of nanotech firm HzO.\n",
      "“We can’t see why every cellphone on the planet shouldn’t be using our technology,” Clayson told FoxNews.com.\n",
      "HzO has created a proprietary gas -- and a special process for applying it -- that essentially wraps an invisible waterproof shell around anything, a shell just a few molecules thick.\n",
      "They call it WaterBlocked.\n",
      "“We take electronics, place them in a vacuum chamber, and apply a thin coating as a gas,” explained Clayson, whose background in industrial coatings makes him well suited to the new company. “It reaches to every nook and crevice in the assembly to create a universal and effective coating.”\n",
      "Awesome? Certainly. Unique? Not so fast.\n",
      "Stephen Coulson, founder and CTO of the British company P2i, says he has also invented a nanofilm that can keep water off smartphones. And Coulson has also invented a unique process for applying it.\n",
      "P2i calls it Aridion.\n",
      "And while Clayson’s HzO plans to be on every cellphone on the planet, Coulson has a nice jumpstart.\n",
      "“It’s on 7 million electronic devices already, not to mention shoes and clothing,” he said of Aridion. Coulson started with a military grant and a good idea before founding P2i. His technology can protect not just phones from water but all sorts of things from all sorts of other things -- and that includes protecting military garments from gasoline, oil, lubricants and even nerve agents.\n",
      "“Things like mustard and VX, which are often referred to as gases but are actually liquids with a substantial water pressure,” he said.\n",
      "Some manufacturer's have already taken the plunge.\n",
      "Fujitsu showed off an Android-powered waterproof tablet called Arrows at the CES Unveiled event in Las Vegas Sun., Jan 8, but the company refused to identify the manufacturer of the technology.\n",
      "It was Liquipel Inc., a third company claiming to have patent-pending technology to waterproof cellphones, tablets, headphones and more, President Danny McPhail told FoxNews.com.\n",
      "His tech is nontoxic, McPhail said, noting that \"current can still travel through\" a device underwater if it has been treated.\n",
      "This much is certain: There’s a need for the companies’ products. According to a June 2011 report from the CTIA Wireless Association, there are over 327.5 million mobile phones in use in the U.S. A separate study from TNS Global says 82.5 million phones have been rendered inoperable to date due exposure to moisture or water.\n",
      "Or the toilet, of course.\n",
      "It sounds silly, but it’s an experience everyone can related to. Clayson said he was getting the oil changed in his car at a Jiffy Lube and showed the technology off by dumping an Apple Nano in a glass of water before a startled engineer.\n",
      "“She went out and got every employee of the Jiffy Lube and brought them in.” One employee there had dropped his phone in the toilet twice that year, she told Clayson.\n",
      "Motorola was first to embrace the technology; it calls the coating “Splash-Guard,” and it’s keeping some Motorola phones safe from a dunking in the toilet. And while neither HzO nor P2i would say how much you’ll pay for a waterproof phone, both confirmed they were in talks with pretty much anyone building phones today.\n",
      "“Other than saying we’re talking to the entire industry, that’s all I can say, ” Coulson told FoxNews.com.\n",
      "Clayson said much the same thing.\n",
      "“Anybody who makes a consumer electronic device … they are a target -- and we’re likely speaking with them.”\n",
      "He also poo-poohed the competition.\n",
      "\"No other formula is nearly as robust,\" Clayson said.\n",
      "He said HzO ran a side-by-side test comparing the Motorola Splash-Guard coating against WaterBlock.\n",
      "\"The Motorola RAZR dies in about 10 seconds,” he said. “Our phone we continue to film for about an hour.\"\n",
      "But whether the coating comes from P2i or HzO, consumers will come out ahead. Your next phone will most likely be toilet-proof. Child-proof . . . that’s a whole other problem.\n",

      "Lightly shocking a person's brain just before they learned a new task appeared to strengthen memory in a handful of patients with epilepsy, a tantalizing result that could have implications for Alzheimer's disease, U.S. researchers said on Wednesday.\n",
      "Pacemaker devices known as deep brain stimulators made by Medtronic and St. Jude Medical are already used to calm muscle tremors in patients with Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders, and are being tested for a host of other conditions such as treatment-resistant depression.\n",
      "The devices are implanted under the skin in the chest with wires leading up the neck connected to tiny electrodes implanted deep in the brain, which produce electrical impulses.\n",
      "The current study was done at the University of California at Los Angeles in seven epileptic patients awaiting surgery who had electrodes implanted deep in their brains to help pinpoint the source of their seizures. The team used this opportunity to see how stimulating the brain affects memory.\n",
      "They focused on an area of the brain called the entorhinal cortex, which helps form and store memories.\n",
      "\"The entorhinal cortex is the golden gate to the brain's memory mainframe,\" Dr. Itzhak Fried, professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, who worked on the study, said in a telephone interview. The research was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n",
      "Fried said sensory experiences that eventually become memories pass through this hub before they are stored in the hippocampus, the brain's chief memory center.\n",
      "For the study, patients played a video game in which they had to shuttle people around in taxis to different shops in a virtual city. The team tested whether stimulating the entorhinal cortex or the hippocampus while they were learning their way around the city improved their recall.\n",
      "\"When we stimulated the hippocampus itself, there was not an effect. It was really stimulation in the gateway to the hippocampus - the entorhinal cortex - where we got the beneficial effect in terms of memory,\" Fried said.\n",
      "Compared to testing before stimulation, zapping this part of the brain helped people recognize landmarks and navigate the virtual city more quickly. Fried said the findings suggest stimulating the brain just as memories are forming is key.\n",
      "Impact on Alzheimer's\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, this area of the brain is affected early on, when signs of dementia begin to appear.\n",
      "Fried said the study might have implications for treatments for patients with early Alzheimer's disease, but he cautioned that the results are very preliminary.\n",
      "\"The question would be whether this can help memory in patients with memory impairments,\" he said. Scientists are increasingly focused on ways to treat the memory-robbing disease, which affects more than 5 million Americans.\n",
      "Despite costly efforts, no drug has been found that can keep Alzheimer's from progressing, and policymakers are growing increasingly worried about the swelling ranks of dementia patients as the population ages.\n",
      "Suzanne Haber, a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York who was not involved in the study, said she was \"very excited about the finding,\" but she cautioned that the treatment is very invasive, very expensive and unproven in Alzheimer's patients.\n",
      "The Obama administration said on Wednesday it plans to spend an additional $156 million over the next two years to help find an effective treatment for Alzheimer's.\n",
      "One team has already tried deep brain stimulation in Alzheimer's patients. In a study published in the Annals of Neurology in 2010 researchers tested deep brain stimulation in six patients over the course of a year and found the treatment to be relatively safe. They also saw signs the treatment might have an effect on memory.\n",
      "Dr. Sandra Black, a brain researcher at the University of Toronto who wrote an editorial on the current study, said the findings could have implications for early stage Alzheimer's disease if tests were developed to identify this process early through imaging or genomics.\n",
      "\"Although the current evidence is preliminary, is based on small samples and requires replication, the potential application of deep-brain stimulation in amnestic disorders is enticing,\" Black wrote.\n",

      "An apparent smoke bomb was thrown over the fence of the White House as hundreds of Occupy protesters massed outside the gates.\n",
      "The crowds were dispersed Tuesday night and the White House was all clear. U.S. Secret Service spokesman George Ogilvie says there were no arrests in the incident.\n",
      "The Obamas were at dinner celebrating Michelle Obama's birthday, but they have since returned to the White House without difficulty.\n",
      "The tense scene outside the White House follows an earlier protest on the West Lawn of the Capitol, in which several hundred protesters affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street movement decried the influence of corporate money in politics and voice myriad other grievances.\n",
      "Organizers had touted the rally, known as Occupy Congress, as the largest national gathering of Occupy protesters to date and secured a permit that would have allowed up to 10,000 people to participate. By mid-afternoon, the protest appeared to have fallen far short of those goals.\n",
      "Still, participants said they were optimistic about the strength of the Occupy movement, which began in September when protesters pitched tents in a lower Manhattan park. The movement has since spread to dozens of cities, including Washington. While many cities have moved to evict the protesters, the National Park Service has allowed encampments to remain in two public squares near the White House.\n",
      "\"I'm encouraged,\" said Jon Wynn, 63, of North Carolina, who traveled to Washington to attend the protest and visit friends. \"There's energy here, even if there's not a whole lot of people.\"\n",

      "The largest Muslim civil liberties group in the United States on Wednesday condemned Newt Gingrich for saying he would only hire Muslims to his administration if they renounced the use of Islam's Shariah law as a tool for U.S. government.\n",
      "Calling Gingrich \"one of the nation's worst promoters of anti-Muslim bigotry,\" the Council of American Islamic Relations suggested the Republican presidential candidate is a segregationist.\n",
      "\"Newt Gingrich's vision of America segregates our citizens by faith. His outdated political ideas look backward to a time when Catholics and Jews were vilified and their faiths called a threat,\" said CAIR Legislative Director Corey Sayolor in a statement.\n",
      "\"The time for bias in American politics has passed and Newt Gingrich looks like a relic of an ugly era,\" Sayolor said.\n",
      "CAIR said the release was prompted by the candidate's remarks Tuesday in Columbia when, asked if he would ever endorse a Muslim running for president.\n",
      "\"It would depend entirely on whether they would commit in public to give up Shariah,\" Gingrich said.\n",
      "\"A truly modern person who happened to worship Allah would not be a threat, a person who belonged to any kind of belief in Shariah, any effort to impose it on the rest of us, would be a mortal threat,\" Gingrich told the crowd, adding that he's \"totally opposed\" to Shariah law being applied in American courts and favors a federal law that \"preempts\" its use.\n",
      "This month, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down an Oklahoma ban on the application of \"Sharia law\" and \"international law\" in courts.\n",
      "Pointing to the religious freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment, CAIR defends Shariah law as a set of beliefs that \"teaches marital fidelity, generous charity and a thirst for knowledge,\" and mandates that Muslims respect the law of the land in which they live.\n",
      "Gingrich had a different interpretation of Shariah law, pointing to the, \"rising Islamization of Turkey has been accompanied by a 1,400 percent increase in women being killed.\"\n",
      "\"When you look at the application of Shariah in places like Iran, when you look at churches being burned in Nigeria and Egypt, and that the decline of Christians in Iraq from a million, 200 thousand when the Americans arrived to about 500,000 today, I think it depends entirely on the person,\" he said.\n",
      "\"If they are a modern person integrated in the modern world and they are prepared to recognize all religions, that's one thing. On the other hand, if they're Saudis, who demand that we respect them while they refuse to allow Christians to worship in Saudi Arabia, that's something different,\" he continued.\n",
      "Later in the day during a question and answer session in Aiken, S.C., Gingrich also called the Ground Zero mosque \"a deliberate and willful insult to the people of the United States who suffered an attack by people who are motivated by the same thing.\"\n",
      "\"I think the time has come for us to have an honest conversation about Islamic radicalism. I don't think we should be intimidated by our political elites, and I don't think we should be intimidated by universities who have been accepting money from the Saudis and who, therefore, now have people who are apologists for the very people who want to kill us,\" he said.\n",

      "A European spacecraft orbiting Mars has found more revealing evidence that an ocean may have covered parts of the Red Planet billions of years ago.\n",
      "The European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft detected sediments on Mars' northern plains that are reminiscent of an ocean floor, in a region that has also previously been identified as the site of ancient Martian shorelines, the researchers said.\n",
      "\"We interpret these as sedimentary deposits, maybe ice-rich,\" study leader Jérémie Mouginot, of the Institut de Planétologie et d'Astrophysique de Grenoble (IPAG) in France and the University of California, Irvine, said in a statement. \"It is a strong new indication that there was once an ocean here.\"\n",
      "As part of its mission, Mars Express uses a radar instrument, called MARSIS, to probe beneath the Martian surface and search for liquid and solid water in the upper portions of the planet's crust.\n",
      "The researchers analyzed more than two years of MARSIS data and found that the northern plains of Mars are covered in low-density material that suggests the region may have been an ancient Martian ocean. [Photos: Red Planet Views from Europe's Mars Express]\n",
      "\"MARSIS penetrates deep into the ground, revealing the first 60–80 meters of the planet's subsurface,\" said Wlodek Kofman, leader of the radar team at IPAG. \"Throughout all of this depth, we see the evidence for sedimentary material and ice.\"\n",
      "The idea of oceans on ancient Mars is hardly new, and features reminiscent of shorelines have been tentatively identified in images from various spacecraft and missions. Still, the concept remains controversial.\n",
      "In fact, this new investigation comes on the heels of a separate study that found that Mars may have experienced a \"super-drought,\" making it parched for too long for life to exist on the surface of the planet today.\n",
      "But, scientists working to document Mars' history have proposed two oceans: one 4 billion years ago when the planet experienced a warmer and wetter period, and one 3 billion years ago when subsurface ice melted after a large impact that created various channels that drained water into areas of lower elevation, the researchers said.\n",
      "Still, the more recent ocean would have only been a temporary feature on the Martian surface, the researchers said. The water would likely have been frozen or preserved underground again, or turned into vapor and lifted gradually into the atmosphere within a million years or less, Mouginot explained.\n",
      "\"I don't think it could have stayed as an ocean long enough for life to form,\" Mouginot said in a statement.\n",
      "The sediments seen by Mars Express are typically low-density grains of material that have been eroded away by water and carried off to their current location. According to the researchers, the MARSIS instrument reveals the sediments to be areas of low radar reflectivity.\n",
      "In the ongoing search for life on Mars, astrobiologists will likely have to delve deeper into the Martian past, when liquid water may have existed for longer periods on the surface, the scientists said.\n",
      "Still, these results are some of the best evidence yet that there were once large bodies of liquid water on the surface of Mars, the researchers said. The findings are also further proof that liquid water likely played an important role in the geological history of Mars, and the planet's own evolution.\n",
      "\"Previous Mars Express results about water on Mars came from the study of images and mineralogical data, as well as atmospheric measurements,\" Olivier Witasse, a Mars Express project scientist at the European Space Agency, said in a statement. \"Now we have the view from the subsurface radar. This adds new pieces of information to the puzzle but the question remains: where did all the water go?\"\n",
      "Mars Express was launched in June 2003 and entered orbit around the Red Planet in December 2003. The spacecraft is scheduled to operate until at least the end of 2012.\n",

      "Neither cold temperatures nor pouring rain seemed to dampen the spirits of the tens of thousands who gathered for the annual March for Life in Washington on Monday. The march serves as an annual pro-life response to the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court's landmark decision legalizing abortion in the U.S.\n",
      "A number of lawmakers spoke at the rally launching the march, which began on the National Mall and proceeded several blocks to the steps of the Supreme Court. House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, vowed to continue standing with pro-life advocates.\n",
      "\"We are heeding the voice of the people who overwhelmingly oppose taxpayer funding of abortion,\" he said.\n",
      "Though Boehner made clear he doesn't believe being anti-abortion is a political position, many of the marchers said they view abortion as a key election year issue. The Rev. Frank Pavone, who heads Priests for Life, says 2012 is critical.\n",
      "\"You're going to hear a lot of talk about getting ready for the elections and increasing the pro-life numbers that we have in the House and Senate and, of course, the White House,\" he said.\n",
      "Pro-choice supporters acknowledge their opponents' success and call it cause for alarm. Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, calls pro-life advances at the state level a threat to freedom of choice.\n",
      "Noting roughly 70 pro-life measures passed across the country in 2011, Keenan told supporters, \"Last year we predicted that our opponents would ignore the public's call to focus on immediate challenges, including the economy, and instead launch an all-out war against women.\n",
      "\"Sadly, our predictions came true at near record levels,\" she said.\n",
      "According to Americans United for Life, more than 460 measures were considered in 47 states last year. The group predicts another heavy round of legislative activity this year.\n",
      "On Monday, young people were a large percentage of the marchers. Groups bearing banners from high schools, colleges, even law schools joined the thousands who walked.\n",
      "Royce Hood, a student at Ave Maria School of Law, said his reason for attending was personal. \"I was born out of wedlock and my mother could have had an abortion with me. Thank goodness she didn't, because I'm here today.\"\n",
      "Pavone thinks that specific reason drives the many young people who are increasingly taking part in the annual march. Their parents were part of the first generation with unfettered access to legal abortion.\n",
      "\"It's amazing to realize that you were not protected when you were in the first nine months of life,\" he said. \"That motivates a lot of young people.\"\n",
      "With so many abortion-related measures on the docket for state legislatures across the country in 2012, it appears the debate will continue.\n",

      "A recent picture of Rowan Carr. Rowan is one of many children across the country who may be affected by the recently announced shortage of methotrexate, a critical chemotherapy drug. Courtesy Brenda Carr\n",
      "Rowan Carr, 4, was diagnosed with cancer after her parents took her into urgent care for a fever in 2010. A blood test showed her blood cell and platelet counts were low, and doctors informed her parents that Rowan suffered from acute lymphatic leukemia, or ALL, which typically affects children between the ages of 2 and 5 and can spread to the lining of the spine and brain.\n",
      "“At the time, she had a high fever – no other symptoms,” said Rowan’s mother, Brenda Carr. “She was just tired. She didn’t have cold or flu symptoms, or anything to indicate a sinus infection. The doctor ran a barrage of tests, and finally, a blood test. They said all her counts are low, and you need to go to Children’s Hospital in Minneapolis today. They’re expecting you.”\n",
      "Rowan, who is from Minnesota, was immediately started on a chemotherapy treatment, including the drug methotrexate. Injected directly into the spinal fluid, the drug has been proven in multiple studies to have the best results in preventing the spread or re-occurrence of ALL.\n",
      "Nearly two years later, Rowan’s cancer is in remission, and she is in the ‘long-term maintenance’ phase of treatment, which focuses on preventing relapse with periodic injections of methotrexate.\n",
      "However, recent reports have emerged that the chemotherapy drug is in danger of running out in hospitals across the country—potentially within two weeks.\n",
      "Hospital supplies have dwindled after Ben Venue Laboratories, one of the nation’s largest suppliers of methotrexate, suspended operations at its Bedford, Ohio, plant in November.\n",
      "The company cited “significant manufacturing and quality concerns” as the reason for the production suspension.\n",
      "“Luckily, Rowan just had her spinal tap yesterday [during which she received methotrexate], so we had no problems getting it for her procedure,” Carr said. “But in three months, when she’s supposed to go back in for another injection, who knows what’s going to happen?”\n",
      "“All I’ve been reading is there’s only a two-week supply, and manufacturers may not have any after that, so it’s a little nerve-wracking,” Carr added. “You’re told what drugs you have to take and when, and they have found this way has a 90-95 percent survival rate. Who knows what the outcome is when you have to substitute drugs or not do the procedure at the correct time interval – what if the survival rate drops to 80-85 percent?”\n",
      "Dr. Bruce Bostrom, a pediatric oncologist at Children’s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, said currently, the hospital is not experiencing a shortage of methotrexate, but their supply could run out within weeks if the drug becomes completely unavailable.\n",
      "“We don’t hoard it,” Bostrom said. “I would suspect if we don’t get it within a few weeks we would probably run out.”\n",
      "One of the issues with methotrexate, Bostrom explained, is that manufacturers cannot add preservatives because the preservative can cause neurological problems or paralysis when injected into the spinal fluid.\n",
      "Therefore, once a vial of the drug is opened, it must be used within 6 to 8 hours to prevent contamination.\n",
      "“The dosage depends on the size of the patient,” Bostrom said. “With a small patient, you may not use the whole vial. Anything you can’t use you have to throw away.”\n",
      "Not the first chemo shortage\n",
      "Now with the possibility of the methotrexate supply running out so soon, hospitals are attempting to reschedule patients to receive treatment on the same day – thus reducing waste. Carr said she had heard this practice was already occurring with other children through an online support group to which she belongs.\n",
      "Bostrom also said hospitals may have to delay therapy or resort to other drugs.\n",
      "“The best way to handle the situation would be to give methotrexate later in the course of therapy, but before the first year of treatment is up,” Bostrom said. “We usually give it starting the fourth or fifth month of treatment, but sometimes we can delay it and give it the fifth or sixth or seventh or eighth month of treatment. Hopefully by doing that, we can get it in within the first year.”\n",
      "This isn’t the first shortage to hit the hospital – and other hospitals worldwide. Bostrom said within the past few months, the hospital has already experienced additional chemotherapy shortages, as well as shortages of anti-nausea medications and other supportive care medicines.\n",
      "Carr said she has experienced issues tracking down certain medications for Rowan—an anti-nausea prescription, for example, took her more than a week for their pharmacy to track down, and other pharmacies she called had the medication in back-order as well.\n",
      "“The group I’m a part of, there are moms in Canada and Australia, and they say if it affects us in the U.S., it affects them as well,” Carr added. “So we’re starting to hear of drug shortages in their area as well.”\n",
      "Bostrom said the drug shortages are a problem that seems to be increasing over the years.\n",
      "“Back in early 2001-2002, it was about 2 to 4 drugs a year reported in shortage,” according to Bostrom. “Now in 2010-2011, it was 22 to 23. I’m sure we’re going to break that record in 2012.”\n",
      "In the mean time, to deal with the methotrexate shortage, Valerie Jensen, associate director of the Food and Drug Administration associate director of the Food and Drug Administration’s drug shortages program, told the New York Times there are four other manufacturers of methotrexate in the U.S., which are all trying to increase production.\n",
      "The FDA is also searching for a foreign supplier to provide emergency imports while domestic companies work to meet current demands.\n",
      "“I hate relying on hope…it’s disheartening,” Carr said. “To have this taken out of everybody’s hands – out the doctors’, parents’, and patients’ hands – we already have enough uncertainty. I want to make sure everything we can do for Rowan is done, and not having a clear path on whether or not this drug is available really makes me sad.”\n",

      "The first episode of ‘Celebrity Wife Swap’ airs on January 3. Tracey Gold (‘Growing Pains’) and Carnie Wilson are two of the wives trade lives. Wilson, 43, is best known as one third of the singing trio Wilson Phillips, who in their heyday had three No. 1 hit singles and sold 10 million copies of their debut album.\n",
      "The mother of two also became famous for her very public battle with weight which culminated with a gastric bypass operation in 1999 that was broadcast on the Internet. She lost 150 pounds but admits that her battle is far from over.\n",
      "Since last year’s hilarious appearance in ‘Bridesmaids,’ the band’s career has been on an upswing. A reality show called ‘Still Holding On,’ will air in April, and concert dates and a new album in the works.\n",
      "FOX411: Were you nervous about doing 'Wife Swap'?\n",
      "Carnie Wilson: Yeah I was actually. I was nervous for my children. Sometimes reality T.V. can be stressful. I didn’t want them to be exposed to any pressure or Hollywood weirdness. [My husband] Rob and I were a bit apprehensive. We knew it was going to get personal. We were going to be compared to their parenting styles, the marriage, the lifestyle, whatever. We knew we were going to feel a little bit vulnerable. We were willing to take the risk because something cathartic always happens, there’s always good lessons learned and you know it keeps me on T.V. and pays the bills.\n",
      "FOX411: What did you learn?\n",
      "Wilson: I could not believe how well behaved Tracey’s four boys are especially when they’re asked to do something.\n",
      "FOX411: Did it make you realize your kids don’t do that?\n",
      "Wilson: Oh yeah. I was like, ‘Oh s**t.’ We have loose rules. For me it’s like, ‘God, why do I have to ask you to do something four times?’ I know they’re not deaf, that they hear me. When Roby [Tracey Gold’s husband] asked his kids to do something they were like f**king trained seals.\n",
      "Also it made me realize the most precious thing between Rob and I is that we have to stay strong and get stronger in terms of the way we honor each other. I realized that I have to slow down. I work so hard, I’m so busy. I realized that I don’t have enough time with Rob and when I saw the way Tracey and Roby are together, they keep that going so well.\n",
      "FOX411: How is your weight these days?\n",
      "Wilson: I’ve had so much stress in the last year so it’s really struggle. I never hide, when I walk down the street, someone’s going to take my picture, that’s what I look like. It’s usually a sh**ty picture. I’m definitely up in weight. I’m looking forward to getting an exercise routine again. It’s like a daily decision. Am I going to eat healthy today or am I going to make some sh**ty decisions?\n",
      "I always think I am one of the the millions and millions of people that struggles with an addiction to food. I don’t know how to relax, that’s my problem. I can’t smoke a joint, I can’t have a glass of wine because I want 10 joints and 10 glasses of wine. That’s my obsessive compulsive and addictive behavior. I’ve really struggled since I’ve become sober. How do I balance that? How can I relax and not overeat? Because I have a lot of pressure in my life. I’m a working mother. I have a two year old and a six year old. You try to pay the bills, you try to keep your life going and there’s pressure. It’s kind of a funny time right now. Negativity has thrown a dark cloud over this whole country and I feel for everybody. I feel very blessed in my life but I also work my ass off. At the end of the day I don’t know how to unwind.\n",
      "FOX411: Do you worry about how your eating issues impact your daughters?\n",
      "Wilson: I find communication is the most important thing. Lola knows I struggle with it. I see Lola loving sugar like all the other children but I also see her pay a little more attention like when there’s a birthday party, I see her being the first in line to get the cake. I see me in her.\n",
      "FOX411: Does that break your heart?\n",
      "Wilson: No, I think she’s going to be alright as long as we’re in control of this. She is an active child. The trouble is in the last year I just fell off the wagon with my exercise routine. That was another thing I saw, Roby and Tracey would take the four boys out walking every day, that’s a great goal to have. I don’t know how many families do that, but s**t, that’s a wonderful and healthy thing to do. So I’m trying to get the kids to do that.\n",
      "I tell her you can have ice cream or cake once in a while. You can have dessert, but you’ve got to give up a carb at a meal or you can’t snack on gummies, you’ve got to have some fruit.\n",
      "FOX411: ‘Bridesmaids’ has completely revitalized your career.\n",
      "Wilson: It’s just been unbelievably beautiful, so much fun and in such a great spirit. It’s been so wonderful and there’s not been a day that goes by where someone doesn’t talk to me about ‘Bridesmaids.’\n",

      "First of all, I was in Rome because I met with cardinals because I wanted to talk to them a little bit about the program that we have called We're all Catholics Now, where we need to stand with Jewish people, Catholics, anybody who's under attack.

      "BU has won the most Beanpot titles with 29, including 28 in the last 46 years. But last season represented a rare flop — the Terriers lost in overtime to Boston College in the first round and then were beaten by Harvard in the third-place game.\n",

Senator Bob Dole says Gingrich was a one-man band who rarely took advice. It was his way or the highway. Senator Tom Coburn called Gingrich's leadership lacking. And Congressman Peter King called him undisciplined. Is that fair, or is some sour grapes from former colleagues?\n",

The coup was in my office, and I was one of the guys that thought Newt wasn't -- was being too cozy with Clinton and was very erratic. And he was erratic at times.\n",

I think we were probably too hard on him.\n",

      "But he did have an erratic nature. I think...\n",
      "VAN SUSTEREN: What does that mean?\n",
      "GRAHAM: I think...\n",
      "VAN SUSTEREN: I mean, that -- I mean, I...\n",
      "GRAHAM: Well, I think...\n",
      "VAN SUSTEREN: ... hear that sort of popular word. Everyone says \"erratic.\" What -- what do they -- what do you mean?\n",
      "GRAHAM: On Monday, we would say, We're not going to give a $500 tax credit to people who don't pay taxes. We're going to give tax credits to people who have a tax liability. He goes to the White House on Tuesday, and by Wednesday, we're giving a $500 tax credit to people who don't pay taxes. That was to me -- that drove us crazy to a certain extent.\n",
      "But now I understand how difficult it is to put deals together. And I think I matured and I think he's mellowed, and those who underestimate Speaker Gingrich do so at their own peril. He's been dead twice. Will he come back again? I don't know.\n",
      "But when you talk about conservatism, when he's on, there is no better messenger for what we believe as conservatives. And when he's not on, he's a danger to himself and others at times. But what I see with this version of Newt Gingrich is a guy who feels more comfortable with who he is.\n",
      "And if you're going to change the place behind me, Washington, if you really want to make change substantial and real, somebody's got to come and rock this place because we're going nowhere quick with the current formula. So from my point of view, Newt's candidacy is OK if he stays in. I don't mind it one bit.\n",
      "VAN SUSTEREN: Well, you used sort of the code word of some of his critics. You said he's danger or erratic. And I mean, if you're sitting out there and you're trying decide who to vote for and you hear that, you know, you really what to know what do you mean by \"danger\"?\n",
      "GRAHAM: Well, I think -- I think President Obama is dangerous in the sense that he's able to sell policies that are not good for the country long term. But I guess what I'm saying about Newt -- why did we lose confidence in him? Because he was changing the game plan. The last group to talk him sort of won the day.\n",
      "But I can't imagine his job, the first time Republicans had the Congress in 40 years, trying to lead a revolution, taking people like me who came here to burn the place down, and governed the country and deal with Bill Clinton, a good politician.\n",
      "Looking back, I appreciate how hard his job was better than I did in 1997. And I'm here to say as the guy was in the coup that looking back, we were too hard on him, and if he got to be the nominee, I think he could win. The only unelectable person running in 2012 is Barack Obama. If we make it about his time in office, there's no way in hell he's going to get rehired because there's nobody in the private sector would hire this guy, given his performance.\n",
      "VAN SUSTEREN: All right, let me switch topics to Afghanistan, news tonight that we may be getting out, at least the combat action, a lot faster.\n",
      "GRAHAM: Yes.\n",
      "VAN SUSTEREN: You shake your head.\n",
      "GRAHAM: Well, if you're trying to win a war and negotiate with the enemy, you want to do so from strength. Bringing home the troops before the second fighting season, September of this year, bringing the surge forces home, means that General Allen doesn't have the surge forces he needs to go into the east. So we shortened the 2012 fighting season and we're punishing the Taliban. If we take combat operations off the table in 2013, that's the second fighting season we've lost, and the Taliban are being punished militarily, and I hate it for these guys and gals who are taking the fight to the enemy with a bunch of politicians who change the rules.\n",
      "Don't you think the Taliban will be encouraged to hear that combat operations are going to be shortened in 2013?\n",
      "VAN SUSTEREN: Well, I...\n",
      "GRAHAM: And that we're going to withdraw all surge forces in September? This is all local politics, domestic politics, at the expense of a military strategy that I think is sound.\n",
      "VAN SUSTEREN: You know, you're in the military, besides being in the U.S. Senate.\n",
      "GRAHAM: Yes.\n",
      "VAN SUSTEREN: You've been over there a number of times. I was there with Secretary of State Clinton, and she told the women in a room -- I remember the Afghani women -- that the United States was not going to abandon them with the Taliban. And I still -- I don't -- you know, I still don't see that in the discussion.\n",
      "GRAHAM: What do you think of...\n",
      "VAN SUSTEREN: What about the women?\n",
      "GRAHAM: What do you think they believe after hearing this announcement that we will short -- that we will not be engaged in full-blown combat operations in 2013? If we're removing the surge forces, which makes the 2012 campaign shortened and we're not going to have a robust 2013 campaign, how do you think those women feel? How do you think the Taliban feels?\n",

      "Lin came off the bench to control a struggling offense, adding seven assists while outplaying Nets All-Star point guard Deron Williams.\n",
      "Amare Stoudemire and Tyson Chandler each added 17 points for the Knicks, who won for just the third time in 14 games. They fell just short in losses to Chicago and Boston over the last two nights before picking up a much-needed victory Saturday.\n",
      "Williams had 21 points and 11 assists for the Nets, while Kris Humphries added 20 points and 12 rebounds.\n",
      "Lin, who played at Harvard, was the catalyst for the Knicks, who have been desperate for production at point guard while they wait for Baron Davis to finally become available. Lin was a hit with the fans practically from the moment he checked in, and some of the loudest cheers of this disappointing season roared through Madison Square Garden when his three-point play made it 95-86 with 2:03 remaining.\n",
      "He scored on the next possession to make it an 11-point game, and teammates hugged him at center court after the buzzer as Pearl Jam's \"Jeremy\" blasted through the arena.\n",
      "Carmelo Anthony had just 11 points on 3 of 15 shooting, perhaps tired on the third straight night of games.\n",
      "The losing has created speculation that Mike D'Antoni's job could be in jeopardy, especially if the Knicks had dropped this one and fallen behind the Nets in the Atlantic Division standings. But he said before the game there was no reason to panic and that he still believed in his players.\n",
      "He had noted how much they struggled to score beyond Anthony and Stoudemire, needing someone else to step up. He found that someone in Lin, the first American-born NBA player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent.\n",
      "The second-year pro has hardly been a factor and even was sent to the NBA Development League recently, where he had a triple-double. But D'Antoni gave him a chance last Saturday while searching for a spark at the end of a road trip, but it's hard to imagine he saw this coming.\n",
      "Lin drove along the baseline and fed Stoudemire for the tiebreaking basket, then scored on his own drive for an 86-82 lead with 4:59 left. Stoudemire scored again, and after a jumper by Williams, Chandler converted a three-point play for a 91-84 lead and Lin put it away from there as \"Jeremy! Jeremy!\" chants broke out.\n",
      "Anthony Morrow had only 11 points on 4 of 12 shooting for the Nets, one night after scoring a career-best 42 points and making an NBA season-high eight 3-pointers.\n",
      "The Nets raced to a 17-7 lead and were ahead 30-20 after one quarter behind 10 points from Williams. But with Lin playing the entire second quarter in rare first-half playing time, the Knicks seemed to get a spark on both ends of the floor.\n",
      "Lin had team highs of six points and three assists in the second quarter, including a lob to Chandler that allowed the Knicks to tie it at 46 with 1:32 remaining. New Jersey took a two-point lead into the half after a basket by Jordan Williams.\n",
      "Notes: Humphries was booed loudly on a few occasions, as he was when the Nets played here in the preseason and in a number of other arenas after his brief marriage to reality star Kim Kardashian. ...

      "Sami Salo, Kevin Bieksa and Chris Higgins also scored and Alexandre Burrows added a pair of assists for the Canucks, who are 25-0-0 when leading after two periods and won the opener of a six-game road trip. Vancouver logged its NHL- leading 20th road win of the season and is 6-0-1 in its past seven as the guest.\n",

      "By Jeremy A. Kaplan\n",
      "advertisement\n",
      "Bond. James Bond. 22 James Bonds, that is.\n",
      "The complete James Bond is coming to Blu-ray -- all the gear, girls and crazy action from all 22 movies -- Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment president Mike Dunn announced Tuesday at the world’s biggest consumer electronics event in Las Vegas.\n",
      "The disk set is available for pre-order today, although pricing and the actual ship date of the kit have yet to be announced.\n",
      "Why Blu-ray?\n",
      "“Details matter,” Dunn said, “from sound quality to scenery.” The new high-definition film format showcases all the nuance that goes into the films, and to take a closer look at those nuances.\n",
      "Panasonic presented a panel of three directors responsible for eight James Bond films -- not to mention two of those Bond girls themselves.\n",
      "Olga Kurylenko from \"Quantum of Solace\" and Caterina Murino from \"Casino Royale\" opened up the event by introducing John Glen (who directed five Bond films including For Your Eyes Only and Octopussy), Martin Campbell (GoldenEye, Casino Royale) and Michael Apted (The World Is Not Enough).\n",
      "The directors then offered a behind the scenes explanation of the thinking that went into some iconic scenes, and how they were translated from the script -- like one from the 1983 classic \"Octopussy\" in which actor Roger Moore surprises a group of militants by piloting a folding-wing plane through the closing doors of a barn, guiding the missile that pursues him directly into a bomb depot.\n",
      "“It wasn’t in the script at all!” John Glen said of the scene.\n",
      "That sequence wasn’t digitally created or enhanced, but instead set up with a barn door near the camera in order to create the illusion that the plane flew through. Throughout the franchise’s history, other directors relied more on film artistry than computer graphics -- such as the ski sequence from the 1977 film “The Spy Who Loved Me,” culminating in a tremendous ski jump off a cliff in the Arctic Circle.\n",
      "“I don’t think it would have been as good if we had done it with CGI,” director Glen said.\n",
      "Gadgets have been an integral part of the Bond franchise since day one, with Q unveiling the newest gizmos to save Bond’s life -- gizmos he invariably destroys, such as the rocket-launching BMW from the 1999 movie “The World Is Not Enough” that ultimately is sawed clean in half.\n",
      "“Q’s not going to like this,” actor Pierce Brosnan notes in the movie.\n",
      "It’s unknown what cool gadgets Bond will use in the 23rd film, “Skyfall.” Beyond the basic plot -- Bond’s MI6 headquarters in England is under attack and he must fight back against a threat close to home -- the newly unveiled website for the movie doesn’t explain much.\n",
      "The movie itself won’t come out until Nov. 9, 2012.\n",
      "Bond fans looking for a fix will have to study the details on YouTube until then -- standard definition only.\n",

      "FACT CHECK: Candidates make errant claims on auto bailout, taxes\n",
      "advertisement\n",
      "Twenty Republican presidential debates later, the head-scratching claims kept coming.\n",
      "Did Mitt Romney really cut taxes as Massachusetts governor, as he asserted yet again? Or did he raise them by hundreds of millions of dollars, as former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum alleged? And how could Newt Gingrich have given the nation four balanced budgets when he was only in Congress for two of them?\n",
      "There was something old, something new, in the misstatements of the candidates Wednesday in what was possibly the last GOP debate.\n",
      "A look at some of the claims and how they compare with the facts:\n",
      "ROMNEY to Santorum: \"You voted to raise the debt ceiling five times without compensating cuts in spending.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: Maybe so, but increases in the debt ceiling were not politically charged in the past as they are now. They just allow the government to pay bills run up by previous Congresses. To not pay them would be like deciding to stop paying a car loan or mortgage. In fact, President Ronald Reagan, an icon to most conservatives, supported increases in the debt limit 12 times over his two terms. The idea of insisting on offsetting spending cuts when raising the debt ceiling is relatively new.\n",
      "------\n",
      "ROMNEY: \"They finally realized I was right.\" -- On the government ushering the auto industry into and out of bankruptcy.\n",
      "THE FACTS: Romney did propose a bankruptcy process for the automakers before the government opted for that course. But there was a tremendous difference between the course he advocated and the one that was taken. GM and Chrysler went into bankruptcy on the strength of a massive bailout that Romney opposed. Neither Republican President George W. Bush nor Democratic President Barack Obama believed the automakers would have survived without that backup from taxpayers. Romney held out the possibility at the time of the government giving certain loan and warranty guarantees that would not have approached the nearly $85 billion bailout.\n",
      "------\n",
      "SANTORUM: \"Gov. Romney even today suggested raising taxes on the top 1 percent.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: Romney's new proposal actually would lower tax rates across the board. The rate for the wealthiest Americans would drop to 28 percent from 35 percent. However, Romney's call for unspecified new limits on tax deductions for higher-income taxpayers makes it impossible, absent more details, to assess the impact on any individual.\n",
      "------\n",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: \"When I was speaker ... we balanced the budget for four consecutive years.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: Gingrich has made this misstatement many times before. He was speaker from January 1995 to January 1999. During budget years 1996 and 1997, when Gingrich was House speaker, the government ran deficits totaling nearly $130 billion. In budget year 1998, which ended Sept. 30, 1998, there was a surplus of $69 billion. And in budget year 1999, during which Gingrich was speaker part of the time, there was a surplus of $126 billion. Thus, Gingrich can only claim credit for contributing to two years of a balanced budget, at most.\n",
      "------\n",
      "SANTORUM: \"Gov. Romney raised $700 million in taxes and fees in Massachusetts.\"\n",
      "ROMNEY: \"We cut taxes 19 times.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: Romney largely held the line on tax increases but the record is mixed. Massachusetts raised business taxes by $140 million with measures mostly recommended by Romney. As well, the Republican governor and Democratic lawmakers raised hundreds of millions of dollars from higher fees and fines, another form of taxation. Romney himself proposed raising nearly $60 million by creating 33 new fees and increasing 57 others. Anti-tax advocates praised his support for income tax cuts while objecting to his course on business taxes and fees.\n",
      "------\n",
      "SANTORUM, on Syrian President Bashar Assad : \"If (Syria) would have been any other country, given what was going on and the mass murders that we're seeing there, this president would have quickly joined the international community, which is calling for his ouster and the stop of this. But he's not. He's not, because he's afraid to stand up to Iran.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: Obama, in a statement Aug. 18, 2011, said: \"For the sake of the Syrian people, the time has come for President Assad to step aside.\" Since then, Obama and officials throughout his administration have repeated dozens of times their call for Assad to leave power immediately. The U.S. also led efforts at the United Nations to win support for a resolution demanding Assad's resignation. It was vetoed by China and Russia, but the Obama administration is now working with European and Arab partners to use diplomatic and economic pressure to force Assad out of power.\n",
      "------\n",
      "ROMNEY: \"I'm going to link the pay of government workers with the pay in the private sector. Government servants shouldn't get more than the people who are paying taxes.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: It's something of a myth that federal workers make out like gangbusters next to their private sector counterparts.\n",
      "The latest Congressional Budget Office study found federal pay is, on average, only 2 percent higher than for comparable private sector workers. The discrepancy is larger among the least educated. Federal employees with just a high school diploma make 21 percent more than similar private workers. But federal workers tend to be more educated, older and concentrated in professional occupations -- and they make 23 percent less, on average than private sector counterparts.\n",
      "That advantage holds true when benefits are added to the mix: The federal professionals still lag, while federal employees with less education have a greater advantage over private sector workers.\n",
      "------\n",
      "GINGRICH: \"If we're going to have a debate about who the extremist is on these issues, it is President Obama, who as a state senator voted to protect doctors who killed babies who survived the abortion.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: As an Illinois state senator, Obama voted against legislation promoted by anti-abortion activists that would have conferred protection to fetuses showing any signs of life after an abortion, even if doctors did not believe the fetus was viable. Obama pointed to an existing Illinois law requiring doctors to protect fetuses they believed were likely to survive after an abortion, and said he was concerned the proposed new law was so broad it could interfere with routine abortions. Obama said he would have supported federal legislation President George W. Bush signed in 2002 that would protect a viable fetus but reaffirmed a woman's right to an abortion.\n",
      "------\n",
      "GINGRICH: \"It is utterly stupid to say that the United States government can't control the border. It is a failure of will. It's a failure of enforcement.\"\n",
      "THE FACTS: A failure of will or enforcement is difficult to see in the statistics. Starting under the Bush administration, the ranks of the Border Patrol have risen to more than 21,400 agents, a force augmented by National Guard troops, unmanned aerial vehicles and fencing. A record 396,609 illegal immigrants were deported last year.\n",
      "In the budget year that ended in September, border agents arrested the fewest number of illegal border crossers -- 327,577 -- in nearly four decades. That's considered a sign that fewer people are trying to cross, whether because doing so is riskier or because economic opportunity in the U.S. is less than before.\n",
      "The debate presses on about whether the border is becoming secure enough, but there has been a measure of success and substantial effort.\n",

      "A draft settlement between states and mortgage companies that would let the nation's biggest banks pay out billions to compensate for a raft of foreclosures has public interest groups across the political spectrum hopping mad over a deal they say was forged behind closed doors and is being strong-armed by the Obama administration.\n",
      "The draft proposal, which was sent to state officials Monday for approval, is supposed to overhaul the mortgage industry and help homeowners. In it, the country's five largest mortgage lenders offer to pay out as much as $25 billion to cover new terms for homeowners driven out by foreclosure. But people who lost their homes are unlikely to get them back or see much financial benefit from the deal.\n",
      "Advocates and watchdogs on both sides of the political aisle are fighting the deal, although for very different reasons.\n",
      "On the left, complaints about the agreement being pushed by the administration center on whether the federal government is letting the banks off the hook for a foreclosure crisis that critics say could've been avoided had the banks been more upstanding about their deals. However, President Obama's supporters also credit him for his plans to launch an investigative unit on abusive lending to be led by the Justice Department, a move announced in the State of the Union Tuesday night and formally launched Friday.\n",
      "The argument from the other side claims the administration is trying to fast track a deal that amounts to extortion of banks that followed federal government rules to expand access to loans.\n",
      "Judicial Watch announced this week that it is suing the Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in an effort to get more information about the settlement offer and the audits that purport to prove the banks defrauded consumers.\n",
      "\"What's going on here is there's this really incredible pressure that's being brought to bear on the banks,\" said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch. \"All Americans deserve to know the full truth about the Obama administration's effort extort $20 billion from the nation's banking industry.\"\n",
      "Fitton said selective leaking of information related to the settlement amounts to a \"gangster government.\"\n",
      "\"This is another game on secrecy the Obama administration is playing,\" Fitton told FoxNews.com. \"It is this type of gamesmanship that has resulted in the Obama administration's transparency crisis.\"\n",
      "Liberal groups like Moveon.org and Campaign for America's Future are criticizing the Obama administration for agreeing to what they say is a weak deal that doesn't hold banks accountable.\n",
      "Color of Change is circulating a petition asking Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder to \"reject a settlement deal that lets Wall Street banks off the hook, protecting them from legal prosecution, and instead, push for a full investigation, compensation to homeowners and real accountability for those responsible.\"\n",
      "At Obama's State of the Union Tuesday night, the president said he was having the Department of Justice create a special unit federal prosecutors and state attorneys general to expand investigations \"into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis.\"\n",
      "\"This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans,\" Obama said.\n",
      "The president's supporters called the investigation a \"clear victory\" for those allegedly cheated by the system, but warned the draft settlement \"must not infringe\" on that probe.\n",
      "The outcome must also include a \"guaranteed minimum amount of money set aside for reducing the mortgage principal of 'underwater' homeowners in key states impacted by the foreclosure crisis.\" said MoveOn Executive Director Justin Ruben.\n",
      "State officials first learned the details of the draft settlement on Monday, and Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who is leading the settlement negotiations, said the states \"won't reach a settlement any time this week.\"\n",
      "While the deal includes changes in foreclosure practices -- a major goal of the Obama administration -- some states are not receptive because they are concerned about being able to pursue separate claims, situation the administration would like to avoid.\n",
      "New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden last year started their own investigation into the mortgage crisis. Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley in December sued five national banks for their role in the foreclosure crisis.\n",
      "On Wednesday, Schneiderman would not indicate how close the two sides are to a deal on the latest proposal.\n",
      "\"Well my concern has always been to make sure that we're not releasing claims that obviously are now even more important than me, because I'm investigating,\" New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Wednesday.\n",
      "Monday evening, the director of the Delaware attorney general's fraud division said Biden is \"opposed to the proposed settlement as drafted.\"\n",
      "\"This position, given his prior public comments, should come as no surprise,\" spokesman Ian McConnel said in a written statement. \"The settlement is currently confidential and when it is made public he will speak more specifically about it.\"\n",
      "The attorneys general of California and Nevada late last year also launched a joint investigation into \"misconduct and fraud in the mortgage industry.\"\n",
      "\"The mortgage crisis is a law enforcement matter, and we will prosecute to hold accountable those who are responsible and also protect the homeowners who are targeted for fraud,\" California Attorney General Kamala Harris said in December.\n",
      "A banking executive familiar with the talks told Fox Business Network this week that the five banks and the attorneys general want California in on the agreement because the state is home to many foreclosures and lawsuits there could get expensive.\n",
      "According to terms of the deal, the five major banks -- Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citibank and Ally Financial -- would apply the settlement only to privately held mortgages issued between 2008 and 2011.\n",

      "Teresa Hunt said she had compromising photos of a \"19 Kids and Counting\" cast member, and wanted $10,000 from Discovery to keep the photos out of the press, according to court documents.\n",
      "The documents did not name the Duggar family member in question, but Radaronline.com identified the woman in the photographs as Amy Duggar, the cousin of family patriarch Jim Bob Duggar.\n",
      "Amy Duggar, who is single, came out with a statement saying the relationship allegations were false.\n",
      "“It’s totally untrue. James is a long time family friend who has always been supportive of my music career,\" Amy Duggar said in a statement to Fox411.com. \"He’s a good Christian and it’s upsetting that his generosity has been exploited like this.”\n",
      "Hunt was arrested on February 1 after sending Discovery the alleged extortion letter, which provided details of Hunt's alleged relationship with a musician who plays in Branson, Mo., and that individual's alleged relationship with a female cast member of the show.\n",
      "An undercover FBI agent posing as a Discovery employee replied to Hunt's letter, the report said. Hunt, who said she was a professional photographer, then emailed three photos to the agent.\n",
      "Hunt's letter also said the Duggars \"claim to be so Christian so they keep popping out more babies to keep their ratings up,\" according to court documents.\n",
      "Hunt said in her email that the musician in question “owes me money” and that she had no reason to hurt the cast member “except that’s she’s on a reality show and pretends to be a right-wing Christian and she’s sleeping with a 56-year-old man.”\n",
      "\"19 Kids and Counting\" has been a hit show on Discovery's sister network TLC since 2008. It follows the extended family of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, who have 19 children.\n",

      "The U.S. and Britain on Sunday urged Israel not to attack Iran's nuclear program as the White House's national security adviser arrived in the region, reflecting growing international jitters that the Israelis are poised to strike.\n",
      "In their warnings, both the chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, and British Foreign Secretary William Hague said an Israeli attack on Iran would have grave consequences for the entire region and urged Israel to give international sanctions against Tehran more time to work. Dempsey said an Israeli attack is \"not prudent,\" and Hague said it would not be \"a wise thing.\" It was not known whether their messages were coordinated.\n",
      "Both Israel and the West believe Iran is trying to develop a nuclear bomb -- a charge Tehran denies. But differences have emerged in how to respond to the perceived threat.\n",
      "The U.S. and the European Union have both imposed harsh new sanctions targeting Iran's oil sector, the lifeline of the Iranian economy. With the sanctions just beginning to bite, they have expressed optimism that Iran can be persuaded to curb its nuclear ambitions.\n",
      "On Sunday, Iran's Oil Ministry said it has halted oil shipments to Britain and France in an apparent pre-emptive blow against the European Union. The semiofficial Mehr news agency said the National Iranian Oil Company has sent letters to some European refineries with an ultimatum to either sign long-term contracts of two to five years or be cut off. The 27-nation EU accounts for about 18 percent of Iran's oil exports.\n",
      "Israel has welcomed the sanctions. But it has pointedly refused to rule out military action and in recent weeks sent signals that its patience is running thin.\n",
      "Israel believes a nuclear-armed Iran would be a threat to its very existence, citing Iran's support for Arab militant groups, its sophisticated arsenal of missiles capable of reaching Israel and its leaders' calls for the destruction of the Jewish state.\n",
      "Last week, Israel accused Iran of being behind a string of attempted attacks on Israeli diplomats in India, Georgia and Thailand.\n",
      "There is precedent for Israeli action. In 1981, the Israeli air force destroyed an unfinished Iraqi nuclear reactor. And in 2007, Israeli warplanes are believed to have destroyed a target that foreign experts think was an unfinished nuclear reactor in Syria.\n",
      "Experts, however, have questioned how much an Israeli operation would accomplish. With Iran's nuclear installations scattered and buried deep underground, it is believed that an Iranian strike would set back, but not destroy, Iran's nuclear program.\n",
      "There are also concerns Iran could fire missiles at Israel, get its local proxies Hezbollah and Hamas to launch rockets into the Jewish state, and cause global oil prices to spike by striking targets in the Gulf.\n",
      "In an interview broadcast on CNN Sunday, Dempsey said Israel has the capability to strike Iran and delay the Iranians \"probably for a couple of years. But some of the targets are probably beyond their reach.\"\n",
      "He expressed concern that an Israeli attack could spark reprisals against U.S. targets in the Gulf or Afghanistan, where American forces are based.\n",
      "\"That's the question with which we all wrestle. And the reason that we think that it's not prudent at this point to decide to attack Iran,\" Dempsey said.\n",
      "Describing Iran as a \"rational actor,\" Dempsey said he believed that the international sanctions on Iran are beginning to have an effect. \"For that reason, I think, that we think the current path we're on is the most prudent path at this point.\"\n",
      "The arrival of White House National Security Adviser Tom Donilon was the latest in a series of high-level meetings between Israel and the U.S. Last month, Dempsey visited Israel, and next month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to visit the White House.\n",
      "Donilon was set to meet with Netanyahu late Sunday, and with Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak on Monday before leaving.\n",
      "Asked whether he believed Israel could be deterred from striking, Dempsey said: \"I'm confident that they understand our concerns, that a strike at this time would be destabilizing and wouldn't achieve their long-term objectives. But, I mean, I also understand that Israel has national interests that are unique to them.\"\n",
      "Hague delivered a similar message in Britain. Speaking to the BBC, he said Britain was focused on pressuring Iran through diplomatic means.\n",
      "\"I don't think a wise thing at this moment is for Israel to launch a military attack on Iran,\" he said. \"I think Israel like everyone else in the world should be giving a real chance to the approach we have adopted on very serious economic sanctions and economic pressure and the readiness to negotiate with Iran.\"\n",
      "In a sign that the diplomatic pressure might be working, Iran's foreign minister said Sunday that a new round of talks with six world powers on the nuclear program will be held in Istanbul, Turkey. Ali Akbar Salehi didn't give any timing for the talks.\n",
      "The last round of talks between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council plus Germany were held in Istanbul in January 2011 but ended in failure.\n",

      "The public health effects of shale gas development need to be rigorously studied as production rapidly spreads in the United States, public health professionals and advocates said on Monday.\n",
      "Advances in the hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, drilling technique have revolutionized the natural gas industry, but researchers said more must be done to evaluate what the shale boom means for the those living near wells.\n",
      "Health groups have concerns including possible air and water pollution from fracking, especially since some operations take place very close to homes and schools.\n",
      "\"We are leaping before we are looking,\" said Jerome Paulson, of the Mid-Atlantic Center for Children's Health and the Environment, at a conference focused on shale gas and public health.\n",
      "\"Those who are drilling and extracting ... have not done the human health research and ecological studies to assure that the process and chemicals they use are the least hazardous possible,\" Paulson said.\n",
      "The Mid-Atlantic center and Physicians, Scientists and Engineers for Healthy Energy sponsored the conference with hopes of setting up a consortium to collect and assess scientific data on the effects of shale development on the public.\n",
      "Past studies of shale gas development have provided varying results sometimes even when they were based on the same information, said Vikas Kapil, a chief medical officer at the Centers for Disease Control.\n",
      "\"This sort of begs for some systematic and organized way to begin to think about how we collect data, the kind of data we collect, and to have some common understanding and transparency in how this work is laid out and organized,\" Kapil said during a speech at the conference.\n",
      "Fracking involves injecting water mixed with sand and chemicals into shale formations at high pressures to extract fuel.\n",
      "The recent spread of fracking has raised concerns among environmentalists, public health advocates and some neighbors of shale wells who worry about issues such as water contamination and increased truck traffic. Some have also linked earthquakes to disposal of waste water from shale wells.\n",
      "Industry groups say fracking has been done safely for decades and that drillers have worked diligently to minimize effects of drilling.\n",
      "Pushing the pause button\n",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to release the first results of its analysis of the effects of shale development on drinking water later on this year.\n",
      "Already, a recent EPA draft report showed that harmful chemicals from fracking fluids were likely present in a Wyoming aquifer near the town of Pavillion.\n",
      "Still, many researchers at the conference complained that federal and state government seemed to be woefully behind the curve when it comes to assessing the health effects of shale gas development.\n",
      "Adam Law, a physician with Weill Cornell Medical College, which helped organize the conference, said the industry has not upheld its responsibility to ensure that its practices are safe and to examine the consequences for public health.\n",
      "The conference was not conceived to be activist, Law told Reuters on the sidelines of the forum. \"This is an attempt to bring the evidence-based community into dialogue.\"\n",
      "While Law said the conference was not \"anti-fracking,\" he said he believes authorities should \"push the pause button\" on shale drilling in new areas until thorough studies can be completed.\n",
      "An industry-backed group that promotes shale gas production said drillers have been using fracking for more than 65 years and the only difference in the current shale boom is the use of horizontal drilling.\n",
      "\"What these guys are essentially arguing is that the mere act of turning a drill bit horizontally, thousands of feet underground, represents a greater risk to health than drilling a well straight down into the formation,\" said Chris Tucker, a spokesman for Energy In Depth.\n",
      "\"It's a position completely unmoored from the facts, from the science and from the demonstrable history of safe operations to which this industry lays claim,\" he added.\n",

The attack at noon targeted a town hall where Christian Igbo people were holding a meeting. The attack, for which the sect, Boko Haram, claimed responsibility, came after the group threatened to begin specifically singling out Christians living in the country’s Muslim north in its increasingly bloody sectarian fight with Nigeria’s weak central government.\n",

      "OF all the challenges faced by college and high school students, few inspire as much angst, profanity, procrastination and caffeine consumption as the academic paper. The format — meant to force students to make a point, explain it, defend it, repeat it (whether in 20 pages or 5 paragraphs) — feels to many like an exercise in rigidity and boredom, like practicing piano scales in a minor key.\n",
      "And so there may be rejoicing among legions of students who have struggled to write a lucid argument about Sherman’s March, the disputed authorship of “Romeo and Juliet,” or anything antediluvian. They have a champion: Cathy N. Davidson, an English professor at Duke, wants to eradicate the term paper and replace it with the blog.\n",
      "Her provocative positions have lent kindling to an intensifying debate about how best to teach writing in the digital era.\n",
      "“This mechanistic writing is a real disincentive to creative but untrained writers,” says Professor Davidson, who rails against the form in her new book, “Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn.”\n",
      "“As a writer, it offends me deeply.”\n",
      "Professor Davidson makes heavy use of the blog and the ethos it represents of public, interactive discourse. Instead of writing a quarterly term paper, students now regularly publish 500- to 1,500-word entries on an internal class blog about the issues and readings they are studying in class, along with essays for public consumption.\n",
      "She’s in good company. Across the country, blog writing has become a basic requirement in everything from M.B.A. to literature courses. On its face, who could disagree with the transformation? Why not replace a staid writing exercise with a medium that gives the writer the immediacy of an audience, a feeling of relevancy, instant feedback from classmates or readers, and a practical connection to contemporary communications? Pointedly, why punish with a paper when a blog is, relatively, fun?\n",
      "Because, say defenders of rigorous writing, the brief, sometimes personally expressive blog post fails sorely to teach key aspects of thinking and writing. They argue that the old format was less about how Sherman got to the sea and more about how the writer organized the points, fashioned an argument, showed grasp of substance and proof of its origin. Its rigidity wasn’t punishment but pedagogy.\n",
      "Their reductio ad absurdum: why not just bypass the blog, too, and move right on to 140 characters about Shermn’s Mrch?\n",
      "“Writing term papers is a dying art, but those who do write them have a dramatic leg up in terms of critical thinking, argumentation and the sort of expression required not only in college, but in the job market,” says Douglas B. Reeves, a columnist for the American School Board Journal and founder of the Leadership and Learning Center, the school-consulting division of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. “It doesn’t mean there aren’t interesting blogs. But nobody would conflate interesting writing with premise, evidence, argument and conclusion.”\n",
      "The National Survey of Student Engagement found that in 2011, 82 percent of first-year college students and more than half of seniors weren’t asked to do a single paper of 20 pages or more, while the bulk of writing assignments were for papers of one to five pages.\n",
      "The term paper has been falling from favor for some time. A study in 2002 estimated that about 80 percent of high school students were not asked to write a history term paper of more than 15 pages. William H. Fitzhugh, the study’s author and founder of The Concord Review, a journal that publishes high school students’ research papers, says that, more broadly, educators shy away from rigorous academic writing, giving students the relative ease of writing short essays. He argues that part of the problem is that teachers are asking students to read less, which means less substance — whether historical, political or literary — to focus a term paper on.\n",

      "KABUL, Afghanistan — American and other coalition forces here are being killed in increasing numbers by the very Afghan soldiers they fight alongside and train, in attacks motivated by deep-seated animosity between the supposedly allied forces, according to American and Afghan officers and a classified coalition report.\n",
      "A decade into the war in Afghanistan, the report makes clear that these killings have become the most visible symptom of a far deeper ailment plaguing the war effort: the contempt each side holds for the other, never mind the Taliban. The ill will and mistrust run deep among civilians and militaries on both sides, raising questions about what future role the United States and its allies can expect to play in Afghanistan.\n",
      "Underscoring the danger, a gunman in an Afghan Army uniform killed four French service members and wounded several others on Friday, according to an Afghan police official in Kapisa Province in eastern Afghanistan, prompting the French president to suspend his country’s operations here.\n",
      "The violence, and the failure by coalition commanders to address it, casts a harsh spotlight on the shortcomings of American efforts to build a functional Afghan Army, a pillar of the Obama administration’s strategy for extricating the United States from the war in Afghanistan, said the officers and experts who helped shape the strategy.\n",
      "The problems risk leaving the United States and its allies dependent on an Afghan force that is permeated by anti-Western sentiment and incapable of combating the Taliban and other militants when NATO’s combat mission ends in 2014, they said.\n",
      "One instance of the general level of antipathy in the war exploded into uncomfortable view last week when video emerged of American Marines urinating on dead Taliban fighters. Although American commanders quickly took action and condemned the act, chat-room and Facebook posts by Marines and their supporters were full of praise for the desecration.\n",
      "But the most troubling fallout has been the mounting number of Westerners killed by their Afghan allies, events that have been routinely dismissed by American and NATO officials as isolated episodes that are the work of disturbed individual soldiers or Taliban infiltrators, and not indicative of a larger pattern. The unusually blunt report, which was prepared for a subordinate American command in eastern Afghanistan, takes a decidedly different view. The Wall Street Journal reported on details of the investigation last year. A copy was obtained by The New York Times.\n",
      "“Lethal altercations are clearly not rare or isolated; they reflect a rapidly growing systemic homicide threat (a magnitude of which may be unprecedented between ‘allies’ in modern military history),” it said. Official NATO pronouncements to the contrary “seem disingenuous, if not profoundly intellectually dishonest,” said the report, and it played down the role of Taliban infiltrators in the killings.\n",
      "The coalition refused to comment on the classified report. But “incidents in the recent past where Afghan soldiers have wounded or killed I.S.A.F. members are isolated cases and are not occurring on a routine basis,” said Lt. Col. Jimmie E. Cummings Jr. of the Army, a spokesman for the American-led International Security Assistance Force. “We train and are partnered with Afghan personnel every day and we are not seeing any issues or concerns with our relationships.”\n",
      "The numbers appear to tell a different story. Although NATO does not release a complete tally of its forces’ deaths at the hands of Afghan soldiers and the police, the classified report and coalition news releases indicate that Afghan forces have attacked American and allied service members nearly three dozen times since 2007.\n",
      "Two members of the French Foreign Legion and one American soldier were killed in separate episodes in the past month, according to statements by NATO. The classified report found that between May 2007 and May 2011, when it was completed, at least 58 Western service members were killed in 26 separate attacks by Afghan soldiers and the police nationwide. Most of those attacks have occurred since October 2009. This toll represented 6 percent of all hostile coalition deaths during that period, the report said.\n",

      "They were known as Miller’s Boys, police officers who worked the 4-to-midnight shift, patrolling the largely working-class town of East Haven, Conn., including the small but growing Hispanic community that has spread out in recent years from New Haven.\n",
      "The officers were more than well known in that community; according to residents and federal authorities, they were feared. They stopped and detained people, particularly immigrants, without reason, federal prosecutors said, sometimes slapping, hitting or kicking them when they were handcuffed, and once smashing a man’s head into a wall. They followed and arrested residents, including a local priest, who tried to document their behavior.\n",
      "They rooted through stores looking for damning security videotapes of how they had treated some of their targets, described by one of them on a police radio as having “drifted to this country on rafts made of chicken wings.”\n",
      "And after it became known that the Justice Department was investigating the department, according to an indictment unsealed on Tuesday, a picture of a rat appeared on a police union bulletin board, and in the locker room, an ominous note: “You know what we do with snitches?”\n",
      "On Tuesday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Sgt. John Miller and three of his officers — David Cari, Dennis Spaulding and Jason Zullo — on charges of conspiracy, false arrest, excessive force and obstruction of justice over what the indictment described as years of mistreatment of individuals, especially Hispanics, and efforts to cover it up.\n",
      "Following on the heels of a scathing Justice Department report in December that found the East Haven police had engaged in widespread “biased policing, unconstitutional searches and seizures, and the use of excessive force,” the indictment portrayed a harrowing picture of arbitrary justice for Hispanic residents.\n",
      "“There is no place for excessive force in a police station or on the streets,” David B. Fein, the United States attorney for Connecticut, said in a news conference on Tuesday. “There is no place for false statements in police reports.”\n",
      "“No person is above the law, and nobody — even a person arrested for a crime — is beneath its protection,” he added, saying there could be more arrests.\n",
      "Janice K. Fedarcyk, assistant director in charge of the F.B.I. office in New York, called the officers “a cancerous cadre that routinely deprived East Haven residents of their civil rights.”\n",
      "The misconduct, according to prosecutors, reached to the highest ranks of the department and the police union. A high-ranking officer described as “Co-Conspirator No.1” — apparently the police chief, Leonard Gallo — made several calls to the supervisor of the priest, the Rev. James Manship of St. Rose of Lima Church, asking that he be moved out of his parish, the indictment said. The same commander also barred members of East Haven’s police commission, a supervisory body that was trying to investigate the complaints, from entering the department without his permission, but later rescinded the order.\n",
      "Police union leaders also inquired about hiring a private investigator to follow the priest, the indictment said, though it was not clear if they followed through.\n",
      "Mayor Joseph Maturo Jr. of East Haven, who served from 1997 to 2007 and was then returned to office in 2011, said he stood by the police force. When he took office again, Mr. Maturo reinstated Chief Gallo, who had been put on paid leave by the previous mayor after the Justice Department began its investigation.\n",
      "“I’m still very surprised, and it’s a sickening feeling to have your officers arrested, but nevertheless they’re innocent until proven guilty,” Mr. Maturo said.\n",
      "As for larger problems in the department, he said, “I have confidence in all the men and women of our East Haven Police Department, from top to bottom.”\n",
      "Each officer was charged with conspiracy against rights, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years, and at least one other charge. Officers Spaulding and Cari were charged with the most serious count, obstruction, which carries a maximum of 20 years.\n",

      "Those who might shudder at the notion of cracking a close friend’s diary feel no compunction about browsing through the timeline of an utter nonconnection. “I’m incredibly intrusive about looking at old girlfriends to see what their kids look like,” said Euan Rellie, an investment banker. “I am constantly looking at people and thinking: ‘What a lovely ski holiday!

      "WASHINGTON — A feared wave of homegrown terrorism by radicalized Muslim Americans has not materialized, with plots and arrests dropping sharply over the two years since an unusual peak in 2009, according to a new study by a North Carolina research group.\n",
      "The study, to be released on Wednesday, found that 20 Muslim Americans were charged in violent plots or attacks in 2011, down from 26 in 2010 and a spike of 47 in 2009.\n",
      "Charles Kurzman, the author of the report for the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security, called terrorism by Muslim Americans “a minuscule threat to public safety.” Of about 14,000 murders in the United States last year, not a single one resulted from Islamic extremism, said Mr. Kurzman, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina.\n",
      "The report also found that no single ethnic group predominated among Muslims charged in terrorism cases last year — six were of Arab ancestry, five were white, three were African-American and two were Iranian, Mr. Kurzman said. That pattern of ethnic diversity has held for those arrested since Sept. 11, 2001, he said.\n",
      "Forty percent of those charged in 2011 were converts to Islam, Mr. Kurzman found, slightly higher than the 35 percent of those charged since the 2001 attacks. His new report is based on the continuation of research he conducted for a book he published last year, “The Missing Martyrs: Why There Are So Few Muslim Terrorists.”\n",
      "The decline in cases since 2009 has come as a relief to law enforcement and counterterrorism officials. In that year, the authorities were surprised by a series of terrorist plots or attacks, including the killing of 13 people at Fort Hood, Tex., by an Army psychiatrist who had embraced radical Islam, Maj. Nidal Hasan.\n",
      "The upsurge in domestic plots two years ago prompted some scholars of violent extremism to question the conventional wisdom that Muslims in the United States, with higher levels of education and income than the average American, were not susceptible to the message of Al Qaeda.\n",
      "Concerns grew after the May 2010 arrest of Faisal Shahzad, a naturalized American citizen, for trying to blow up a sport utility vehicle in Times Square. Mr. Shahzad had worked as a financial analyst and seemed thoroughly assimilated. In a dramatic courtroom speech after pleading guilty, he blamed American military action in Muslim countries for his militancy.\n",
      "The string of cases fueled wide and often contentious discussion of the danger of radicalization among American Muslims, including Congressional hearings led by Representative Peter T. King, a Long Island Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security.\n",
      "But the number of cases declined, returning to the rough average of about 20 Muslim Americans accused of extremist violence per year that has prevailed since the 2001 attacks, with 193 people in that category over the decade. By Mr. Kurzman’s count, 462 other Muslim Americans have been charged since 2001 for nonviolent crimes in support of terrorism, including financing and making false statements.\n",
      "The 2011 cases include just one actual series of attacks, which caused no injuries, involving rifle shots fired late at night at military buildings in Northern Virginia. A former Marine Corps reservist, Yonathan Melaku, pleaded guilty in the case last month in an agreement that calls for a 25-year prison sentence.\n",
      "Other plots unearthed by law enforcement last year and listed in Mr. Kurzman’s report included a suspected Iranian plan to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States, a scheme to attack a Shiite mosque in Michigan and another to blow up synagogues, churches and the Empire State Building.\n",
      "“Fortunately, very few of these people are competent and very few get to the stage of preparing an attack without coming to the attention of the authorities,” Mr. Kurzman said.\n",

      "GRANTHAM, England — It is a poignant story, and the sparse audiences at the Reel Cinema, a few blocks from the handsome 18th-century facades of the town center, tell it as well as anything else.\n",
      "Here in Margaret Thatcher’s hometown, a stolid, hard-working sort of place in the flatlands of Lincolnshire that played its part in forming Mrs. Thatcher’s no-nonsense, spare-me-the-excuses character, there is not a lot of fuss, nor much in the way of sentiment, to be found about the woman who went on to become Britain’s longest-serving prime minister of the 20th century.\n",
      "Only on afternoons when the cinema offers retirees half-price tickets has there been much of a crowd for “The Iron Lady,” the controversial film about Mrs. Thatcher, who is now 86. On both sides of the Atlantic, it has won rave reviews for Meryl Streep’s performance in the lead role — offset by criticism of the film’s focus on Mrs. Thatcher’s often humiliating battle in recent years with dementia.\n",
      "That view found echoes among the moviegoers, though some noted that the film had prompted a succession of the former prime minister’s friends and associates to say that the portrayal, though unkind, is not wholly inaccurate. One former minister, Jonathan Aitken, has said that Mrs. Thatcher, at a recent London party, appeared perplexed at the mention of David Cameron, as though she did not recognize that he is the current Conservative prime minister.\n",
      "Beyond that controversy, the film has prompted a new season of passionate debate in Britain about the political legacy of the Thatcher years, measured by a rush of commentary that has shown how little the opposing poles of opinion, the admiration and the vituperation, have relented since 1990. That was the year when a revolt among her own cabinet ministers and Mrs. Thatcher’s famous House of Commons shout of “No! No! No!” on any further integration with Europe brought an end to her premiership after 11 years.\n",
      "In Grantham, 120 miles north of London on the route to Scotland, the debate has been less vigorous, but the poles are here, too. For every resident who spoke admiringly of the way “Mrs. T” handled the big issues — the battles with the unions, the retrenchment of the postwar welfare state, the Falklands war, the cold war confrontation with the Soviet Union — there were two or three others who disparaged her as too bossy, too uncaring toward society’s have-nots and too little interested in tending to her Grantham roots.\n",
      "Even in the red-brick shop on the corner where she grew up as a grocer’s daughter, the mood was dyspeptic. Only a modest plaque marks the building as “The birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, the first woman prime minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.”\n",
      "The old grocery, once a laboratory for the shopkeeper’s economics that became a hallmark of Thatcherism, now serves as the Living Health Chiropractic Clinic and Holistic Retreat, offering marine algae body wraps and hypnotherapy treatments.\n",
      "Few visitors seek out the site these days, said Sandra Green, a receptionist, and those who do mostly come when Mrs. Thatcher is “in the news, or not feeling well.” A therapist, Lauren Hall, 24, had her own perspective. “People who come to Grantham are more interested in Isaac Newton,” who attended school in the town from 1655 to 1661 and has a statue in the town’s main square, she said. In case the visitor had not grasped Newton’s place in history, she offered a prompt. “Did you know he invented the cat flap?” she said.\n",
      "The only hometown politician who merits a statue is Frederick James Tollemache, a 19th-century lawmaker with a minor role in promoting the settlement of New Zealand. From more recent times, it is Alfred Roberts, Mrs. Thatcher’s father and a former Grantham mayor, who commands respect.\n",
      "The one place where a sense of pride in the town’s famous daughter was palpable was the Kesteven and Grantham Girls’ School, on a blustery height across the River Witham from the town center. There, a gold-lettered entry on the honors board shows that Margaret Roberts was head girl in 1943, the year she won a place to study chemistry at Oxford.\n",
      "“She was always very determined,” said Ian Todd, the assistant headmaster, who escorts visitors on tours of the school. When she wanted to take science courses not available at the Kesteven school, she arranged to go to a local boys’ school, and did her studies there, he said. “And she taught herself Latin for the Oxford entrance exams.”\n",
      "A group of students clustered at a table in the lobby studying for an examination in religious studies — the topic for the moment was Immanuel Kant, the 18th-century German philosopher — seemed keen to mark their distance, too. “She was the first woman prime minister, and I admire her for that,” said Grace Dawson, 18.\n",
      "But Emily Cheesman, 17, chimed in. “I don’t know particularly what she did,” she said. “But I know a lot of people have bad feelings towards her, because she did her thing, and a lot of people didn’t like that. And I think she might have harmed other women’s chances of becoming prime minister.”\n",
      "Back in the town center, there were those with firsthand memories of the Thatcher years who disagreed, some of them vigorously. “I liked her a lot,” said Michael Calladine, 42, a weather-beaten landscape gardener unloading logs at the Angel and Royal Hotel, on the site of a 13th-century inn that played host to a succession of English kings, including Richard III. “She pulled the country out of a slump,” Mr. Calladine said, “and when you look at the idiots who have run the country into the ground since her, well, what can you say?”\n",

      "For more than a decade they have been joined at the hip, the police chief with an old-school, tough-guy reputation and the mayor who resurrected the officer’s flagging career, made him his chief and then stood by him at every turn.\n",
      "Now East Haven’s mayor, Joseph Maturo Jr., and its police chief, Leonard Gallo, are linked even tighter, a day after this blue-collar New Haven suburb was turned upside down by the federal indictments of four police officers accused of harassing, beating and retaliating against Hispanics in town and people who spoke up for them.\n",
      "Chief Gallo was not charged, but was referred to in the indictment as “Co-Conspirator No. 1,” who, it said, tried to thwart investigations of his officers and tried to have a priest who protested their behavior removed from his parish.\n",
      "But on Wednesday it was Mr. Maturo facing the most immediate criticism, as he quickly backpedaled from comments he made to a WPIX (Channel 11) reporter Tuesday.\n",
      "Asked what he was doing for the Latino community in light of the indictments and accusation of harassment, illegal searches and seizures and assaults on Latinos, Mr. Maturo responded on camera: “I might have tacos when I go home. I’m not sure yet.”\n",
      "Facing a blizzard of criticism — Gov. Dannel P. Malloy called his comments “repugnant” and said they represented “either a horrible lack of judgment or worse” — Mr. Maturo apologized, at first grudgingly and then with a long statement offering his “sincerest apologies” for what he called an “insensitive and off-collar comment.”\n",
      "He added: “Unfortunately, I let the stress of the situation get the best of me and inflamed what is already a serious and unfortunate situation. I regret my insensitive comment and realize that it is my job to lead by example.”\n",
      "There were calls for Mr. Maturo to resign, but Chief Gallo could face the bigger legal challenge. Federal officials said they could file further charges, and Chief Gallo may still be under review.\n",
      "Chief Gallo and Mr. Maturo have come to symbolize one side of the partisan divide in a place with one foot in its past as a close-knit, blue-collar, predominantly Italian community and the other in a more diverse present, where the Hispanic population has grown to 10 percent.\n",
      "After serving for a decade as mayor, Mr. Maturo, a retired firefighter, lost by 25 votes in 2007 to April Capone Almon, who at 32 became the town’s youngest mayor and its first woman to hold that office. In November, he defeated her by 34 votes in a bitter rematch.\n",
      "The town is now divided again, this time in reaction to the indictments.\n",
      "Frank Rubino Jr., 50, a retired construction worker, said he approved of the mayor and the police chief and said that Latinos were “just trying to take advantage of the situation.”\n",
      "He said he objected to seeing local signs in Spanish as well as English. “As far as the police officers, I think they’re just doing their job,” he said. “I have never had a problem with them, and I’ve lived here all my life in the same house.”\n",
      "Another resident, Kathryn Trieschmann, 70, had no defense for the police.\n",
      "“I don’t believe in racial profiling, and that should be done away with,” she said. She added: “Everybody needs a chance in this country. My grandparents came from Ireland during a time when it wasn’t very acceptable, and they endured. At the time, they were shunned.”\n",
      "The police in East Haven have been under a microscope since 1997, when officers shot an unarmed black man, Malik Jones, at close range, an issue still alive in court appeals.\n",
      "According to The New Haven Independent, a news Web site, before Mr. Maturo hired Chief Gallo in 1998, the chief had been a rising star in the New Haven Police Department, at a time when many black residents complained of rough treatment by the police, including a group of New Haven officers known as the “Beat-Down Posse.”\n",
      "Under New Haven’s first black mayor, John Daniels, much of the department leadership was pushed into retirement, and Mr. Gallo, as a captain, was put in charge of the city’s animal shelter.\n",
      "But Mr. Maturo returned him to prominence, and stood by him in an era when crime rates were low but conflict in the department was incessant — and, finally, after a two-and-a-half-year federal investigation focused on how the department dealt with minorities.\n",
      "When Mr. Maturo returned to office in November, he quickly reinstated Chief Gallo, who had been put on administrative leave by Ms. Capone Almon while the investigation proceeded. Chief Gallo immediately restricted access to officers by the local commission that oversees the police. A scathing report by the Justice Department in December said Mr. Gallo and other officers created “a hostile and intimidating environment for persons who wished to cooperate with our investigation.”\n",
      "Chief Gallo’s lawyer, Jonathan J. Einhorn, criticized the Justice Department for referring to Chief Gallo, however cloaked, in the indictment without charging him with a crime. Since his New Haven days, he said, the chief has had a reputation as an officer who “solved crimes, was a smart police officer and incredibly honest.”\n",
      "Mr. Einhorn said it was impossible to divorce the allegations against the department and Chief Gallo from East Haven politics. “I think people should not be too quick to judge,” he said.\n",

      "THAT didn’t last long. Just 20 months after retiring his PBS series “Bill Moyers Journal,” Mr. Moyers was back in the studio on a Wednesday morning in December, deep in conversation about moral political psychology with the author Jonathan Haidt .\n",
      "The interview veered from Manichean thinking among baby boomers to the social conservative understanding of karma, all as it related to the roots of the country’s political divide. Mr. Moyers worked his way through a sheaf of notes, as the scheduled 90 minutes stretched a good hour longer. (“This is fun,” he said to his guest during a pause.) Emerging from the studio, he said he had decided mid-interview that the discussion would probably take up the entire hour on his new weekly program, rather than be a 20-minute segment.\n",
      "“Bill Moyers Journal” ended in April 2010 because Mr. Moyers, now 77, said he needed a break from the incessant demands of weekly television. But there’s no sign he is easing up this time around.\n",
      "The new show, which begins this month on public television stations, has a different name, “Moyers & Company,” and a warmer set, featuring a blue-and-green background. But much will carry over from the old program, including Mr. Moyers’s thoughtful interviews with thinkers who wouldn’t otherwise get much television face time and a focus on the country’s most pressing political and economic questions. “I’m coming back because in tumultuous times like these I relish the company of people who try to make sense of the tumult,” Mr. Moyers writes on his Web site, billmoyers.com.\n",
      "In an interview in his sprawling new Manhattan office he said that during his break he explored the possibility of a documentary on Lyndon B. Johnson, the president he served as press secretary, but decided that “today is more interesting than yesterday.” Also a factor: the passionate viewers who write him by the hundreds and stop him on the street to talk about his past programs like “On Our Own Terms: Moyers on Dying,” from 2000.\n",
      "Aided by 30 employees (just over half that of “Journal”), Mr. Moyers has banked interviews in recent weeks with the former Reagan budget chief David Stockman, the former Citibank chief executive John S. Reed and the poet Rita Dove (with whom he read “The Hill” by Edgar Lee Masters). He also held a marathon four-hour chat with the political scientists Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson, authors of “Winner-Take-All Politics,” which he called “the most important book I’ve read” since ending the old show; it will provide the backbone for his first three episodes.\n",
      "The seeds of Mr. Moyers’s return were planted several months after his last show ended by Vartan Gregorian, president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York.\n",
      "When “Bill Moyers Journal” ended, “I was very sad,” Mr. Gregorian said in a telephone interview, praising the host’s intelligence and “the respect with which he approached everyone, whether he agreed with them, to know their ideas.” Mr. Moyers, he added, helps in “enlightening our democracy” — a Carnegie mission — by putting “before our nation questions that we should discuss.” The Carnegie Corporation, which was instrumental in the founding of public television, gave Mr. Moyers a lead gift of $2 million for the new show.\n",
      "In an odd twist, however, “Moyers & Company” is not being distributed by PBS, but by American Public Television, a separate distribution service. Viewers will find it at a hodgepodge of times, but Mr. Moyers is so popular that many stations are scheduling multiple broadcasts. In New York WNET will run it on Sundays at 6 p.m. starting on Jan. 15, with a rebroadcast Mondays at 10 p.m.\n",
      "Mr. Moyers said he was unsure why PBS, where he has spent most of his career since 1971, declined the show for its main schedule. Some public television executives, who would not publicly comment on a sensitive issue, said they believed that PBS did not want to realign itself with Mr. Moyers, a longtime target of some conservatives, as it was fighting to keep its federal financing.\n",
      "In a statement a PBS spokeswoman, Anne Bentley, said of Mr. Moyers that “we respect him immensely and the outstanding work he has done,” and that PBS had discussed carrying the show. She did not address why he wasn’t offered a prime spot. PBS will, however, stream the show at video.pbs.org.\n",
      "No longer tied to PBS, Mr. Moyers was free to create his own Web site, where for the first time much of his work, old and new, will be in one place. He is soliciting viewer participation, writing: “This will be a political series but not a partisan one. In the conversation of democracy, everyone’s invited. That means you too.”\n",
      "In the interview Mr. Moyers added that with the Web site, “we don’t have to worry about somebody at PBS losing sleep over the fact that David Stockman says the Republicans have lost their minds on taxes.”\n",
      "His return comes as public television executives are debating their path: More “Downton Abbey,” or local and national news? So far public affairs programming is losing. PBS canceled “Now” when “Bill Moyers Journal” ended; the replacement show “Need to Know” was recently trimmed from one hour to 30 minutes.\n",
      "Yet, Mr. Moyers noted, PBS announced an additional version of “Antiques Roadshow” just a few weeks after the Census Bureau released figures showing the number of people living in poverty had risen to more than 46 million.\n",
      "“I love ‘Antiques Roadshow,’ ” he added. “But it is just symbolic of how we’re not connected viscerally to the state of the American people right now.”\n",
      "In November he called for executives at local stations to come to grips with financing and governance issues that he contends threaten public television’s future.\n",
      "“We’re just hanging on, leaking away, fraying at the margins, scrambling year by year to survive, hoping all the while for what in an era of trillion-dollar deficits and austerity will never be: more and more funding from Congress,” he said in a speech to his colleagues. “What we need is a makeover of our own” to help “realize the goals of our founders: diversity, public access, civic discourse, experimentation, a welcoming place for independent spirits.”\n",
      "Many stations are already on that path, said Rich Homberg, president of Detroit Public Television, adding, “I think we need an army of people to read that speech and go act on it.” He said Mr. Moyers has been “an important voice for a long time, and we welcome him back.”\n",

      "SHANGHAI — China said on Friday that it would begin to publish more detailed air quality data on Beijing later this month, following a public outcry over official government readings that critics said underestimated the severity of the air pollution problem in the smog-filled capital.\n",
      "Beijing plans to publish hourly air quality reports based on an international standard known as PM 2.5, which measures tiny particles that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter, according to an announcement on the Web site of the Beijing municipal government. Those are the particles that are considered the most serious health hazard.\n",
      "Big cities in China, including Beijing, generally publish air quality data that measure particles that are up to 10 microns in diameter. Using that standard has allowed Beijing to record more than 250 “blue sky days” during each of the past two years.\n",
      "China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection also said early Saturday that monitoring pollution levels using the PM 2.5 standard would be included in a newly amended draft of national air quality standards, according to Xinhua, the state news agency.\n",
      "The public’s anger over declining air quality has been intensified by hourly readings released by the United States Embassy in Beijing. Those reports, released on a Twitter feed, use the 2.5 standard and paint a far grimmer picture of the city’s air problems, annoying Chinese officials and alarming residents who are aware of the feeds.\n",
      "Beijing’s “blue sky days” have often turned up in United States Embassy readings as “unhealthy.”\n",
      "In 2009, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official pressed the United States Embassy to stop reporting the data, saying the information was “confusing” and “insulting,” according to a State Department cable published by WikiLeaks. The embassy continues to release the readings via Twitter.\n",
      "Twitter is blocked by the Chinese government, but some Chinese are able to access the site, and republish the data.\n",
      "During the past year, smog has forced the city to periodically close highways, cancel flights and even cope with state-run media assaults on health problems caused by poor air quality.\n",
      "Public anger over traffic jams and smog in the capital is doing economic and political damage to the city’s leaders. Some prominent bloggers, including the real estate tycoon Pan Shiyi, have sharply criticized the government’s official readings on microblogs and encouraged others to vote online about whether Beijing should publish more detailed air quality readings.\n",

      "Never mind those Ferris Bueller and “Star Wars”-themed Super Bowl ads. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has shot a Super Bowl ad, too, and he thinks it is pretty funny, though with a serious message.\n",
      "The half-minute ad features Mr. Bloomberg and Boston’s mayor, Thomas M. Menino, ribbing each other as they cheer for their respective teams and cities. But then they turn to the purpose of their spot, declaring that one thing they agree on is the need for stricter federal gun control laws.\n",
      "The two mayors are longtime allies on gun control and founders of a group called Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which has pushed for a stronger federal background check system.\n",
      "Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Menino shot the ad in New York early Tuesday. And, just as big Super Bowl advertisers like Honda and Volkswagen have been promoting their ads with previews on YouTube, Mr. Bloomberg publicized his at an appearance later Tuesday morning.\n",
      "“It was very funny; you should take a look at it,” he told reporters in a news conference at the Pershing Square Signature Center, the new home of the Signature Theater.\n",
      "Mr. Bloomberg then mentioned the ad on Twitter.\n",
      "“We disagree on who’ll win the #Superbowl, but @MayorTomMenino & I agree on fighting illegal guns. Tune in Sunday,” the mayor (or one of his Twitter surrogates) wrote, attaching a photo of the shoot. In the picture, the mayors are sitting on a couch as though they are watching the game, with Mr. Bloomberg wearing a New York Giants jersey and Mr. Menino a New England Patriots jersey over their dress shirts and ties. (Mr. Bloomberg’s tie, for the record, was blue.)\n",
      "On a coffee table before them are strewn several Giants and Patriots hats, as well as bowls of popcorn and chips — the kind of salty snacks that Mr. Bloomberg is known for publicly deploring but privately adoring.\n",
      "The ad will be shown regionally, rather than nationally, meaning that, according to Mr. Bloomberg’s press office, the spot will cost only “hundreds of thousands of dollars,” rather than the average of $3.5 million that NBC is charging for a 30-second national advertising buy. The ad is being paid for by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, to which Mr. Bloomberg is a contributor.\n",
      "In a telephone interview, Mr. Menino said the ad was partly aimed at politicians in Washington.\n",
      "“It’s a fun way to get a very serious message across to the decision makers,” he said, adding, “If you want to hunt or you need a gun for protection of your business, O.K., but there’s too many loopholes.”\n",
      "The Super Bowl produces some of the most talked-about ads of the year, often featuring celebrities and filmed by some of the biggest agencies in the business. Last year, one of the most popular was a “Star Wars”-themed ad from Volkswagen. This year, Honda is already drawing attention with an ad it has previewed on YouTube for its CR-V, a compact S.U.V., featuring Matthew Broderick revisiting his role as the teenage malingerer Ferris Bueller.\n",
      "Mr. Bloomberg’s press office said that the mayors’ ad was produced by SKDKnickerbocker, a communications firm that also produced spots for his 2009 re-election campaign. Mr. Menino said he and Mr. Bloomberg first talked about doing the ad a week ago.\n",

      "Re “Research Bought, Then Paid For,” by Michael B. Eisen (Op-Ed, Jan. 11):\n",
      "As a not-for-profit publication, The New England Journal of Medicine has for more than a decade provided all its research articles (not just those financed by the federal government) free to the public after six months. We have no intention of changing that policy.\n",
      "The journal provides authors of federally funded research with electronic versions of their articles for submission to the National Library of Medicine and encourages them to authorize free public access to the articles after six months. Articles of particular importance to the health of the public are available at no charge at the time of publication.\n",
      "Mr. Eisen understates the value added to medical research articles by journals such as ours. Peer review is invaluable in selecting the highest impact medical research and improving its quality before publication.\n",
      "There is also important value added by our staff editors, statisticians and graphic designers, among others.\n",
      "The journal has taken no position on the Research Works Act, which would forbid government agencies from requiring that federally financed research be freely accessible online. We will continue to support the National Institutes of Health’s Public Access Policy. Our overarching interest is in improving the health of the public through the publication and wide dissemination of the highest quality medical information.\n",

      "Scholarly publishing relies on peer review to validate and improve papers before publication, and peer review depends crucially on scientists’ willingness to provide expert advice without charge.\n",
      "Nevertheless, Michael B. Eisen’s implication that the peer review process is essentially free is not correct. The management of the peer review process for our 10 large journals requires 50 full-time professional editors with a Ph.D. in physics, and they must be compensated.\n",
      "We need to sell low-cost subscriptions to pay for the peer review process and to publish excellent journals that serve the worldwide scientific community. We also have three journals whose costs are explicitly paid for by article-processing charges, and these journals are open access and freely available.\n",
      "The American Physical Society feels strongly that the public should have access to all of the physics research that we publish. We allow public libraries access to every paper we have ever published, beginning in 1893, for free use by anyone in the library. The Library of Congress was the first of some 500 libraries to join this program.\n",

      "Last week, Oxfam and Save the Children released a report saying that emergency relief in the Horn of Africa came months late, costing thousands of lives and millions of dollars. Oxfam and Save the Children conclude that humanitarian assistance should be done differently. The anti-foreign aid establishment is using the report to argue that aid doesn’t work and should be cut across the board.\n",
      "The very fact that $2.1 billion has been donated to help the victims of the famine is a testament to human beings’ generosity. But that fact of our generosity also explains why I am so frustrated by the increasing opposition in many rich countries to foreign aid.\n",
      "We know people care about the suffering of others. Not only that. They are willing to express their caring by making significant donations, even in very hard times. So what keeps them from supporting government investments to alleviate extreme suffering?\n",
      "According to public opinion research, many people believe aid is either stolen by corrupt leaders or wasted on ineffective programs. Naturally, no one is eager to make investments they’re convinced won’t pay off.\n",
      "There is also the argument that aid doesn’t work even when it gets to its intended recipients. This claim is not convincing either. In the past 50 years, the number of children who die every year has gone down from 20 million to fewer than 8 million. Meanwhile, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has declined by more than half. These massive improvements are due in large part to aid-funded programs to buy vaccines and boost farmers’ productivity.\n",
      "I am confident that we can get the price of AIDS drugs down to $300 per person per year in the very near future. That will mean that every $300 a country gives to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and malaria represents a person who will stay alive for another year. Every $300 that’s not forthcoming represents a human being who will almost certainly die. That is a stark but realistic way to think about the choices we’re making when we debate aid budgets.\n",
      "My hope is that we can convert some of the generosity that goes into humanitarian relief into stronger support for foreign aid programs.\n",
      "Many of those suffering in the Horn of Africa were going hungry before there was a recognized emergency in the region. In fact, more than 1 billion people in the world don’t have enough food to eat.\n",
      "One of the most powerful solutions to this problem is to help poor farmers get more out of their tiny plots of land. In parts of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa especially, farmers plant low-yielding seeds, climate change is starting to shrink their harvests, and plant diseases are invading their fields.\n",
      "New seeds and other tools can help farmers cope with these challenges. For example, my foundation helped fund the development of a variety of rice that can survive flooding and will feed an extra 30 million people every year in Bangladesh and India. That additional rice will not only prevent starvation but also help farmers earn more so they can take sick children to the doctor and pay school fees.\n",
      "The question is, how do we continue to do the research needed to develop these new tools? Poor countries are investing more in their own agricultural sectors, but they don’t have the resources to lead on R&D. Aid is a key piece of the puzzle, and right now the entire research budget of the group responsible for agricultural science for the poorest is just $300 million per year. It’s a shame to see such a high-leverage opportunity generate such ambivalence.\n",
      "I am proud to live in a world where a stranger’s suffering matters. Yet foreign aid, the best way to address that suffering, has a growing legion of critics. That is a contradiction we must remedy, and the best way to do it is to tell the truth about aid.\n",

      "Only yesterday it was the exotic stuff of spy shows: flip on a computer and track the enemy’s speeding car.\n",
      "But today, anyone with $300 can compete with Jack Bauer. Online, and soon in big-box stores, you can buy a device no bigger than a cigarette pack, attach it to a car without the driver’s knowledge and watch the vehicle’s travels — and stops — at home on your laptop.\n",
      "Tens of thousands of Americans are already doing just that, with little oversight, for purposes as seemingly benign as tracking an elderly parent with dementia or a risky teenage driver, or as legally and ethically charged as spying on a spouse or an employee — or for outright criminal stalking.\n",
      "The advent of Global Positioning System tracking devices has been a boon to law enforcement, making it easier and safer, for example, for agents to link drug dealers to kingpins.\n",
      "Last Monday, in a decision seen as a first step toward setting boundaries for law enforcement, the Supreme Court held that under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, placing a GPS tracker on a vehicle is a search. Police departments around the country say they will be more likely to seek judicial approval before using the devices, if they were not already doing so.\n",
      "Still, sales of GPS trackers to employers and individuals, for a multitude of largely unregulated uses, are growing fast, raising new questions about privacy and a legal system that has not kept pace with technology. This easy tool for recording a person’s every move is a powerful one that, when misused, amounts to “electronic stalking,” in the words of one private investigator.\n",
      "“That, to the victim, is just as terrifying as seeing your face in the window at night before they go to bed,” said the investigator, John J. Nazarian, who heads an investigation agency based in Los Angeles.\n",
      "So many suspicious spouses are now doing their own spying, a private investigator in New Jersey said, that his infidelity business is declining.\n",
      "In the absence of legislation in most states, putting a GPS device on a spouse’s car, or hiring an investigator to do so, is widely considered to be legal if the person placing it shares ownership of the car. But some privacy experts question this standard, and there is little to stop a jealous suitor, or an abusive man trying to prevent a battered woman from escaping, from doing the same.\n",
      "GPS trackers are increasingly being cited in cases of criminal stalking and civil violations of privacy.\n",
      "One increasing use of GPS tracking — by as many as 30,000 parents, one seller estimates — is to monitor the driving habits of teenagers; some devices even send a text message when the car goes over a certain speed.\n",
      "Jimmie Mesis, a private investigator in New Jersey who, with his wife, Rosemarie, publishes PI Magazine and also sells devices through a company called PIgear, recalled a couple whose 17-year-old daughter had a drug problem and would disappear for hours at a time. Worried that she might overdose, they placed a tracker on her car. When they saw that she was visiting the same house repeatedly, they informed the police, who raided the drug den.\n",
      "Also rising is the placement of devices in the cars or pockets of elderly parents with dementia. Mr. Mesis said one client with an erratic 86-year-old father discovered that he had driven to the southern end of the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey, and they were able to retrieve him.\n",
      "Even if done legally and out of concern for family members, the covert use of GPS devices poses ethical questions. “To have this as a routine tool strikes me as pretty chilling,” said Jonathan Zittrain, professor of law and computer science at Harvard University. “We are talking about partners and spouses, not pets.”\n",
      "“It cuts into someone’s autonomy to know where they are all the time and not give them the opportunity to opt out,” he said.\n",
      "Rick Johnson, a private investigator in Denver, recalled two recent cases in which women who were going through divorces hired him because they believed that their husbands were following them. He found GPS trackers on their cars and removed them.\n",
      "“It scared the hell out of these women,” Mr. Johnson said.\n",
      "Sales of GPS trackers to private individuals may have already surpassed more than 100,000 per year, some experts believe. The marketing is just getting started.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — Military spending has transformed the faded farmlands of northern Virginia into a land of glass-block office parks, oversize homes and sleek cars. Average household incomes there are among the highest in the United States.\n",
      "The wellspring of this prosperity is not just the Defense Department’s vast payroll, nor just the fat profit margins of its contractors. It is also the Pentagon’s unmatched record in developing technologies with broad public benefits — like the Internet, jet engines and satellite navigation — and then encouraging private companies to reap the rewards.\n",
      "And as the Pentagon confronts the prospect of cutting its budget by about 10 percent over the next decade, even some people who do not count themselves among its traditional allies warn that the potential impact on scientific innovation is being overlooked. Spending less on military research, they say, could reduce the economy’s long-term growth.\n",
      "“If catalyzing innovation is going to be an important part of our economic strategy, then we better be careful how we handle” the military budget, said Daniel Sarewitz, director of the Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes at Arizona State University. “I’d like to see a lot less weapons and a lot less focus on them, but it’s not all about that.”\n",
      "In the political debate over Pentagon cuts, the potential effect on innovation has been largely ignored. Pentagon officials and their allies have instead warned that a sharply smaller military budget would expose the nation to harm, and that such cuts would result in a large and immediate rise in unemployment.\n",
      "Independent economists and analysts say that concern about the short-term economic impact is largely misplaced. While reducing the Pentagon’s budget would cause considerable economic pain — some workers would lose their jobs; some contractors would lose their most important customer — research suggests it would be less painful than cutting other kinds of government spending, like education or transportation.\n",
      "A significant portion of the military budget, including the wages of armed forces personnel, is spent abroad. And military spending in this country, like building a new runway at a domestic Air Force base, tends to bring fewer spillover benefits than many other forms of government spending, like a new runway at a commercial airport.\n",
      "“As a source of job creation, military spending is not particularly good,” said Robert Pollin, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. “You can argue for the benefits in geopolitical terms, but if we’re talking about jobs and the economy, it doesn’t make sense.”\n",
      "The one exception may be Pentagon spending on research and development.\n",
      "The Pentagon spends about 12 percent of its budget in that area, about $81.4 billion during the most recent fiscal year. That is roughly 55 percent of all federal spending on research and development.\n",
      "Administration officials, members of Congress and Pentagon planners could choose to spare the research budget when making cuts. Historically, however, significant reductions to the Pentagon’s budget have led to reductions in research spending, too. Through both flush and lean times for the Pentagon, research spending has accounted for a roughly similar share — between 9 and 13 percent — of the overall budget.\n",
      "It is a pot of money with a remarkable record of success. The Navy, which started budgeting for research in 1946, counts 59 eventual Nobel laureates among the recipients of its financing, including Charles H. Townes, whose pioneering work in the development of lasers laid the groundwork for compact discs and laser eye surgery. The other armed forces claim similar numbers of laureates, albeit with considerable overlap.\n",
      "The results of this research played a key role in the blossoming of high technology as a driver of the nation’s economic growth. In northern Virginia, many of the largest companies continued to work for the Pentagon while also pursuing private contracts.\n",

      "The pale five-story brick building, on a drab residential block, looks like many others in the Bronx. But every floor, the police said, was devoted to a single purpose: growing marijuana .\n",
      "Investigators discovered 593 marijuana plants on Tuesday in a raid of the building, at 610 Morris Park Avenue, in the Van Nest neighborhood, the police said. Three men were arrested, they said, in connection with the so-called grow house.\n",
      "The authorities found 75 pounds of marijuana that had been cut, dried and packaged in plastic. The total amount of marijuana recovered from the site was estimated at 1,550 pounds. The police figured that 50 to 60 pounds, with a value of approximately $250,000, were being produced each month.\n",
      "Some of the plants stood seven feet tall. In one picture released by the police, a lieutenant can be seen wading through two rows of plants that rise well above his head, beneath the glow of a lamp.\n",
      "Brian Munoz, 24; Diego Reyes, 25; and Victor Reyes, 23, all from the Bronx, were charged with criminal possession of marijuana and using drug paraphernalia.\n",

      "“The situation there does not allow the leadership to be present,” a Hamas official in Gaza said. “There are no more Hamas leaders in Damascus.” The official and others, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Hamas leaders had left the Syrian capital because of security concerns.\n",
      "But they said that Hamas, which rules here in Gaza, had not yet made a decision about closing its Syrian offices or where to moves its headquarters. Mr. Meshal has spent most of the past month on the move in the region.\n",
      "Hamas had hailed the Arab revolts that toppled the governments in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, but it was embarrassed when Syrian dissidents moved against President Bashar al-Assad, who has played host to exiled Palestinian leaders for years.\n",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Meshal is scheduled to make his first official visit to Jordan since he was deported in 1999. Qatar, one of Mr. Assad’s most vocal Arab critics, played mediator in arranging for Mr. Meshal’s visit to Jordan, which is expected to include a meeting with King Abdullah II. Jordan was the first Arab country to urge Mr. Assad to step down.\n",
      "Hamas announced this month that Mr. Meshal wished to step down as the chief of the movement’s political bureau, which he has led since 1996, but the exact nature and meaning of his resignation remain unclear. Some said the announcement was a sign of an internal power struggle, others as a maneuver aimed at displaying his popularity. Still others said that Mr. Meshal had his eyes on a bigger position beyond Hamas.\n",

      "JINAN, CHINA — The machinery maker Shandong Heavy Industry Group sealed a deal Tuesday to take a 75 percent stake in the debt-laden Italian luxury yacht maker Ferretti, the latest in a series of Chinese acquisitions of European brands.\n",
      "Chinese companies have been taking advantage of Europe’s financial woes by picking up assets relatively inexpensively, acquiring top brands as a shortcut to global success.\n",
      "The deal for the Italian company also reflected the growing demand for luxury in mainland China, where new marinas are sprinkled along the southern coast.\n",
      "“China is one of the most rapidly developing countries for the yachting sector and has great potential,” the companies said in a statement released at a signing ceremony in Jinan, in eastern China.\n",
      "The Ferretti Group chairman, Norberto Ferretti, said the deal would help his company tap the global yacht market, estimated at €7 billion, or $9 billion, “and meet growing Chinese demand for luxury goods for the coming 5 to 10 years.”\n",
      "Ferretti’s management team, headquarters and production bases will remain in Italy, the companies said. Shandong Heavy said it planned to build yachts in China for the domestic market.\n",
      "“China offers an opportunity to our companies, especially when our economy is not going well,” said Anton Francesco Albertoni, head of the Italian marine industry association, Ucina.\n",
      "Italy has long dominated the yachting industry, which contributes €3.36 billion to the country’s economy annually.\n",
      "“Chinese are learning fast and well,” Mr. Albertoni said. “They love their marinas and golf clubs.”\n",
      "Shandong Heavy will seek a separate share listing for Ferretti in Hong Kong in three to five years, the chairman, Tan Xuguang, said.\n",
      "Under the deal, Ferretti’s roughly €580 million of existing loans will be reduced to €116 million. In addition, Ferretti will receive a new €80 million revolving credit facility, said John Davison, global head of strategic investment at Royal Bank of Scotland, one of Ferretti’s main creditors.\n",
      "Shandong Heavy will make a €178 million equity investment for its 75 percent stake in the business. There will also be a €100 million capital increase, Mr. Ferretti said.\n",
      "Lenders will receive the remaining 25 percent stake in Ferretti through an additional €25 million equity injection, with Royal Bank of Scotland and Strategic Value Partners each receiving half.\n",
      "Founded in 1968, Ferretti was saddled with €1.2 billion of debt in 2007 after the company’s leveraged buyout by Candover Partners.\n",
      "The company defaulted on its debt in January 2009 during the economic downturn.\n",
      "Ferretti’s lenders agreed in April 2009 to write down the debt to €560 million in return for a 53 percent stake from Candover, which lost its investment in the firm.\n",
      "Shandong Heavy makes construction machinery, power systems, commercial vehicles and automobile parts. It is the parent of the diesel engine maker Weichai Power, whose shares are listed in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. Shandong Heavy had operating income of 107.6 billion renminbi, or $17 billion, in 2010.\n",
      "Ferretti, which owns the Pershing, Riva and Ferretti Yachts brands, ranked first in the 2011 Global Order Book, the benchmark annual report on the nautical industry by the magazine ShowBoat International.\n",
      "The 2008 crisis hit the yacht industry hard, prompting many companies to seek partners in cash-rich emerging countries, a trend that is likely to continue as the euro zone’s debt crisis shows no signs of abating. In China, yacht imports increased threefold from 2009 to 2010.\n",
      "“The opening of new marinas, yachting facilities and yachting events in China, especially on the southern coast, is actually fueling demand for yachts,” said Olivier Burlot, managing director of the international yacht brokerage firm Simpson Marine, based in Hong Kong.\n",

      "This week’s stage requires the pros to play many roles: competitor, swing coach, caddie and straight man.\n",
      "The celebrity presence, Points said: “Gets the fans and everybody really excited. Sometimes that’s a sacrifice that I guess we have to make for the greater good of this tournament and the growth of golf.”\n",
      "For Black, who played golf for Speake High in Alabama, the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am is another audition. He made his film debut in 1994 at age 11 in the Kevin Costner film “The War” and worked steadily during his teenage years. He is probably best known for his roles in the movies “Sling Blade” and “Friday Night Lights.” As a consequence, he said, “I didn’t think of being a professional golfer when I was in high school.”\n",
      "He thinks about it now. Black’s dream is to one day put acting on the back burner and turn up the intensity on golf.\n",
      "“I got back into playing amateur tournaments a few years ago,” he said, “and just competing in them kind of sparked the bug and got me thinking, ‘Maybe I can take this elsewhere.’ ”\n",
      "Robert Duvall played Black’s spiritual mentor in “Utopia,” the third film in which they have worked together (the others were “Sling Blade” and “Get Low”). He has described Black as one of Hollywood’s best golfers, never mind that he and his wife live in Columbia, Mo., where the winters are not conducive to lowering one’s handicap.\n",

      "TUCSON — The last few years have not been kind to the Old Pueblo, as this city is known. The collapse of the housing market sapped its growth. Boycotts over the state’s immigration policies kept tourists away. The shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords shook its residents.\n",
      "Then there was the departure of Major League Baseball. Last year, for the first time since Harry S. Truman was president, no professional baseball teams held spring training here. Without the White Sox, Rockies or Diamondbacks, Tucson no longer felt like a big-league town; tens of millions of dollars vanished with them.\n",
      "The teams had left for Phoenix and surrounding cities that dangled taxpayer-subsidized stadiums and the prospect of shorter commutes because all 15 clubs that train in Arizona are now nearby. Tucson was also hurt by the loss of a college bowl game, a golf tournament and a Triple-A baseball team, before replacements were found.\n",
      "But the city is bracing for an economic lift — and a small measure of revenge — when six Major League Soccer teams arrive in the coming weeks to train here for the first time. Four of them — the Los Angeles Galaxy, the New England Revolution, the New York Red Bulls and Real Salt Lake — will also compete in the Desert Diamond Cup, a two-week tournament that could draw as many as 50,000 fans and fill some of the void.\n",
      "“We’re excited about soccer because baseball really let us down, let down the community,” said Richard Elías, a member of the Pima County Board of Supervisors, which owns the facilities where the teams will play. “It’s a big opportunity for us, filling up those restaurants and hotels.”\n",
      "For Mr. Elías and other native Tucsonans, becoming a hub for soccer in Arizona is about more than just money; it is about pride. Tucson suffers from a second-city syndrome found in places like Reno, Nev., and St. Paul. While Tucson is old and rich in history, it has long lived in the shadow of Phoenix, which is almost three times as large and far wealthier. As one businessman observed, “There are dimes in Tucson and dollars in Phoenix.”\n",
      "In some ways, Tucson orbits alone. It leans Democratic in a heavily Republican state. Phoenicians have five professional sports teams to root for; Tucsonans call the University of Arizona Wildcats their home team. Tucson is closer to Mexico, 60 miles to the south, than to Phoenix, 120 miles north.\n",
      "Tucsonans are proud of their long ties to baseball — Mr. Elías and others recall watching Willie Mays, Randy Johnson and other greats — but soccer is perhaps a more natural fit in a city where clubs and schools are brimming with thousands of players. This month, Tucson hosted an annual youth tournament that drew 327 teams from six states, the city’s fourth-largest tourist event.\n",
      "Latinos, who make up about 40 percent of the population, add to the soccer craze. So do the thousands of Mexicans who came last year to see the Red Bulls and Sporting K. C. play an exhibition match that filled Hi Corbett Field even though the event was put together just weeks before. The teams also played F. C. Tucson, a new, home-grown amateur team.\n",
      "“That told us that we have a strong soccer culture here that hasn’t been activated yet,” said Greg Foster, co-founder of F. C. Tucson Events, which organized those games and this year’s spring training as a way to support F. C. Tucson. “It may not replace Major League Baseball, but it may replace it in a different way.”\n",
      "The surprising reception to last year’s exhibition match caught the eye of Major League Soccer, which hopes to create a spring training format similar to baseball’s Grapefruit and Cactus Leagues in Arizona and Florida. If Tucson can continue to draw big crowds and improve its stadiums, the league would be willing to send more business its way, said Nelson Rodriguez, an executive vice president of the league.\n",
      "Even though the teams do not start arriving in earnest until next month, restaurants, bus companies and high-end hotels are ready to embrace them and their fans.\n",
      "The loss of the baseball teams “definitely impacted our business as well as Tucson as a community, but the M.L.S. teams are the first positive signs of professional sports coming back,” said Richard A. Brooks, the director of sales at the Westin La Paloma Resort and Spa, where four teams are staying. The hotel, he said, expects to generate twice as much income from soccer as it did from baseball.\n",
      "Studies show that relying on sports to jump-start an economy can be a fool’s errand. Stadium construction jobs come and go, and much of the other work, like selling tickets, hot dogs and programs, is done by part-time workers who are paid low wages. In many cases, there is little net gain to a local economy because fans who attend sporting events use money that they would otherwise have spent at movie theaters, restaurants or malls.\n",
      "Spring training, though, is different because many fans come from out of town, pumping money into local businesses. The teams and their fans used to spend about $16 million in Tucson during spring training. Without spring training last year, Pima County had to use about $1 million from its general budget to make the bond payments on its sports facilities because the hotel and car rental tax receipts that used to service that debt had declined.\n",
      "For better or worse, many cities like Tucson use sports as a way to gauge their civic self-worth. Many residents hope that by hosting soccer spring training camps and supporting their own team, F. C. Tucson, their city will finally have something Phoenix does not.\n",
      "“There is a sense of rivalry, because we know we’re not like them,” said Magdalena Barajas, a member of a fan group that supports F. C. Tucson. “It feels great, like owning a team, and we’re stepping up for Tucson.”\n",

      "BP, which is based in London, must indemnify Halliburton for compensatory damage claims under its drilling contract, Judge Carl J. Barbier of the United States District Court in New Orleans ruled on Tuesday. BP sued Halliburton, which provided cementing services for the project, in April to recover a share of any damages and costs from the spill. Any punitive damages awarded against Halliburton do not have to be paid by BP, the judge said.\n",
      "“BP is required to indemnify Halliburton for third-party compensatory claims that arise from pollution or contamination that did not originate from the property or equipment of Halliburton located above the surface of the land or water, even if Halliburton’s gross negligence caused the pollution,” Judge Barbier wrote.\n",
      "Any civil penalties under the Clean Water Act against Halliburton, which is based in Houston, also will not have to be covered by BP, the judge said.\n",
      "The decision follows an earlier ruling that BP must indemnify Transocean, owner of the Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded and sank.\n",
      "Judge Barbier said he would not rule yet on BP’s claim that Halliburton committed fraud by concealing material information about the cement tests it conducted. A ruling against Halliburton on this issue may make the company liable for damages.\n",
      "Scott Dean, a BP spokesman, did not immediately comment on the ruling. Beverly Blohm Stafford, a spokeswoman for Halliburton, did not immediately respond to e-mail and voice messages seeking comment.\n",
      "In April 2010, a blowout and the explosion that followed killed 11 workers and set off the worst offshore oil spill in United States history. The accident led to hundreds of lawsuits against BP and its partners and contractors.\n",

      "PARIS — Barely a week after European regulators ordered inspections of the entire Airbus A380 fleet for cracks in a wing component, the company confirmed Friday that it was recommending the replacement of a half-dozen rivets near the jet’s nose with stronger ones.\n",
      "The modification, which the European Aviation Safety Agency said it expected to make mandatory within the next month for all sixty-eight A380s currently in service, aims to reduce the risk that the affected fasteners might fail and cause an in-flight emergency.\n",
      "Marcella Muratore, an Airbus spokeswoman, said the company had identified the problem with the aluminum rivets in October and had started replacing them on aircraft still in production with rivets made of titanium, a more robust metal. The rivets in question connect the plane’s radome, or nose cone, to the fuselage.\n",
      "Ms. Muratore said the latest modification was “totally unrelated” to numerous hairline cracks that were first found late last year in dozens of L-shaped brackets that connect the aluminum skin of the A380’s enormous wings to its structural ribs.\n",
      "“This involves a totally different part and place in the aircraft,” she said, adding that regulators had been aware of the issue since last year. Neither the wing bracket cracks nor the rivets issue posed an imminent safety risk, she said.\n",
      "In a notice to airlines published in the past week, the European Aviation Safety Agency recommended that airlines replace the six affected rivets within the next eight months. Failure to replace the rivets, it said, “could lead to in-flight loss of the radome in case of rapid decompression and could adversely affect the structural integrity of the airplane.”\n",
      "Airbus said that the modification was being made as a precaution and that the odds of an in-flight event were “extremely remote.” Replacement of the rivets should cause “minimal inconvenience” for airlines, Ms. Muratore said.\n",

      "Joseph E. Brooks, a retail executive who doubled the size of the Lord & Taylor chain and made its flagship New York store a showplace of spectacle, including elaborate retail stagecraft and a daily morning rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” died on Thursday in Manhattan. He was 84.\n",
      "The cause was leukemia, said his daughter Elizabeth Rains. Mr. Brooks lived in Greenwich, Conn.\n",
      "Mr. Brooks became chairman and chief executive of Lord & Taylor in 1975 during a recession brought on by the 1973 oil embargo, convinced that expansion was the cure for the company’s lagging sales. He added 26 stores to the chain, which had 19 when he began, and by the time he resigned in 1987 had more than quadrupled annual sales, to $825 million from about $200 million.\n",
      "The Fifth Avenue flagship became a promotional stage and Mr. Brooks its frequent master of ceremonies. He oversaw a $5 million renovation that included the installation of travertine marble floors, mirrored columns and walls and teak wood cabinetry.\n",
      "He inaugurated a ceremony, the Rose Award, which became an annual black tie event of the New York social calendar, held on the newly beautified first floor. The award honored a distinguished American — Beverly Sills, Claudette Colbert, Lillian Hellman and Ella Fitzgerald were among the recipients — and filled the store for the night with the kind of people Mr. Brooks apparently wanted shoppers to think of when they entered a Lord & Taylor.\n",
      "He told The New York Times in 1976 that he viewed Lord & Taylor as a store “that appeals to mass with class — people with good taste and understated elegance who like to buy investment clothes.” By investment clothes, he said, he meant expensive things that would last and could be worn for special occasions year after year.\n",
      "“This was all before the Walmarts and Targets came along, and changed the retail business,” said Gerald Blum, who was executive vice president for marketing and sales when Mr. Brooks was president. “He had a flair for the theatrical, and a real love of the business.”\n",
      "Mr. Brooks was credited with nurturing and promoting American clothing designers, including the young Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren, at a time when European fashion was dominant among major American retailers.\n",
      "Beginning in 1980, during the Iran hostage crisis, Mr. Brooks ordered that “The Star-Spangled Banner” be played each morning at the start of business throughout the store. He wanted to remind people, he said, that “with all its problems, this is still the greatest country in the world.”\n",
      "He was born in Philadelphia on Nov. 2, 1927, and attended public schools and Pennsylvania State University before entering the sales training program at an Abraham & Straus store in Brooklyn. Before joining Lord & Taylor, the largest division of the Associated Dry Goods Corporation, he was president of Filene’s Basement in Boston and held several executive positions in stores owned by the former Federated Department Stores Inc., now known as Macy’s Inc.\n",
      "In addition to his daughter Elizabeth, Mr. Brooks is survived by his wife, Alice; a son, Thomas; another daughter, Victoria, and five grandchildren.\n",
      "Mr. Brooks acknowledged deep disappointment at not becoming chief executive of Lord & Taylor’s parent company, an ambition that was thwarted in 1986 when Associated was acquired by May Department Stores. After resigning in 1987, he led a leveraged buyout of the Ann Taylor chain for $430 million. He added almost 100 new stores to that retail chain before a downturn in sales led him to resign in 1992.\n",
      "But Lord & Taylor was always first in Mr. Brooks’s heart, Mr. Blum said.\n",
      "Mr. Brooks, he said, told friends he would have run the place for nothing.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — In what may be its most significant religious liberty decision in two decades, the Supreme Court on Wednesday for the first time recognized a “ministerial exception” to employment discrimination laws, saying that churches and other religious groups must be free to choose and dismiss their leaders without government interference.\n",
      "“The interest of society in the enforcement of employment discrimination statutes is undoubtedly important,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote in a decision that was surprising in both its sweep and its unanimity. “But so, too, is the interest of religious groups in choosing who will preach their beliefs, teach their faith and carry out their mission.”\n",
      "The decision gave only limited guidance about how courts should decide who counts as a minister, saying the court was “reluctant to adopt a rigid formula.” Two concurring opinions offered contrasting proposals.\n",
      "Whatever its precise scope, the ruling will have concrete consequences for countless people employed by religious groups to perform religious work. In addition to ministers, priests, rabbis and other religious leaders, the decision appears to encompass, for instance, at least those teachers in religious schools with formal religious training who are charged with instructing students about religious matters.\n",
      "Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Virginia who argued the case on behalf of the defendant, a Lutheran school, said the upshot of the ruling was likely to be that “substantial religious instruction is going to be enough.”\n",
      "Asked about professors at Catholic universities like Notre Dame, Professor Laycock said: “If he teaches theology, he’s covered. If he teaches English or physics or some clearly secular subjects, he is clearly not covered.”\n",
      "The case, Hosanna-Tabor Church v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, No. 10-553, was brought by Cheryl Perich, who had been a teacher at a school in Redford, Mich., that was part of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, the second-largest Lutheran denomination in the United States. Ms. Perich said she was fired for pursuing an employment discrimination claim based on a disability, narcolepsy.\n",
      "Ms. Perich had taught mostly secular subjects but also taught religion classes and attended chapel with her class.\n",
      "“It is true that her religious duties consumed only 45 minutes of each workday,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote, “and that the rest of her day was devoted to teaching secular subjects.”\n",
      "“The issue before us, however, is not one that can be resolved with a stopwatch,” he wrote.\n",
      "Instead, the court looked to several factors. Ms. Perich was a “called” teacher who had completed religious training and whom the school considered a minister. She was fired, the school said, for violating religious doctrine by pursuing litigation rather than trying to resolve her dispute within the church.\n",
      "The Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said Wednesday’s decision could have pernicious consequences, by, for instance, barring suits from pastors who are sexually harassed.\n",
      "“Blatant discrimination is a social evil we have worked hard to eradicate in the United States,” he said in a statement. “I’m afraid the court’s ruling today will make it harder to combat.”\n",
      "Bishop William E. Lori, chairman of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops’ ad hoc committee for religious liberty, called the ruling “a great day for the First Amendment.”\n",
      "“This decision,” he said in a statement, “makes resoundingly clear the historical and constitutional importance of keeping internal church affairs off limits to the government — because whoever chooses the minister chooses the message.”\n",
      "Chief Justice Roberts devoted several pages of his opinion to a history of religious freedom in Britain and the United States, concluding that an animating principle behind the First Amendment’s religious liberty clauses was to prohibit government interference in the internal affairs of religious groups generally and in their selection of their leaders in particular.\n",

      "My plan had been to give the N.C.A.A. a rest this week; there are, after all, other problems in the world. But then, at 6:15 on Saturday evening, the N.C.A.A. announced that it was reinstating Ryan Boatright , the University of Connecticut freshman who had been suspended from the men’s basketball team, and whose mother, Tanesha, had been the subject of a horrific investigation that I had previously written about .\n",
      "Even this bit of good news was double-edged for the Boatrights, however. In handing down its ruling, the N.C.A.A. issued a press release so malicious in its intent that I could not let it pass. Longtime watchers of the N.C.A.A. tell me that they have never seen an athlete and his mother thrown under the bus the way Ryan and Tanesha Boatright were on Saturday. One rarely gets so clear a glimpse of moral bankruptcy. (I’ve annotated the press release on my blog at http://nocera.blogs.nytimes.com.)\n",
      "In essence, the release says that Ryan and Tanesha received $8,000 in “impermissible benefits” from two people it describes as having “improper third-party influence over student-athletes and their families.” That sounds bad, doesn’t it?\n",
      "But what exactly constitutes “improper third-party influence?” When I put this question to Stacey Osburn, the author of the N.C.A.A. press release, she said it means someone who takes advantage of an athlete “for personal gain.” One example would be a “third party” paying off an athlete’s family to help steer him to a particular school. Another would be fronting for a sports agent, who hopes to eventually land the player as his client. (Agents are forbidden under the N.C.A.A.’s definition of amateurism.)\n",
      "In its release, the N.C.A.A. neither names the third parties nor explains what they stood to gain. But one of them is already known: Reggie Rose, Ryan’s former A.A.U. coach and the brother of Derrick Rose, the Chicago Bulls star. According to the N.C.A.A., Rose paid for Tanesha to accompany her son on four recruiting trips. He made some payments on her 2008 Impala. And Rose took Ryan on a two-day trip to California where he got to scrimmage with some top-notch players.\n",
      "Why did he do this? Clearly, he wasn’t trying to steer Ryan to a particular school. And he certainly wasn’t fronting for an agent; as good as he is, Ryan is not a sure-fire pro.\n",
      "In fact, he did it because he and Tanesha have a longstanding friendship. He became a mentor to Ryan, something teenagers of single moms desperately need. Indeed, he took Ryan to California because Ryan’s household was under an unusual amount of stress at the time. How is this wrong? Indeed, what exactly is the N.C.A.A. violation here? The N.C.A.A. never says.\n",
      "I have since come to learn that the N.C.A.A. takes a dim view of Reggie Rose. It certainly has a right to its opinion. I’ve also heard that the N.C.A.A. is deeply suspicious of mentors to disadvantaged athletes. Its working assumption is that men who get close to high school athletes must have nefarious motives. Well, some surely do, but some don’t. The idea that Reggie Rose is not allowed to help Tanesha because the N.C.A.A. disapproves of him is, by any measure, offensive.\n",
      "There is another issue. The parents of upper-middle-class athletes don’t have problems with the N.C.A.A. when they want to go on recruiting trips with their children. They just write a check. And they don’t get into financial binds that cause them to need help with car payments. It is not an accident that most serious N.C.A.A. “scandals” involve athletes and parents who are disadvantaged. It smells of discrimination.\n",
      "On Sunday morning, Tanesha’s lawyer, Scott Tompsett, released an angry statement refuting the N.C.A.A.’s allegations and decrying its publication of material the family had been told would remain confidential. The Boatrights, he said, will “consider their legal options.”\n",
      "But the Boatrights aren’t going to sue, and the N.C.A.A. knows it. Ryan only wants to play basketball. Tanesha just wants the whole thing to go away. Her life has been turned upside down by the N.C.A.A.’s investigation: She’s lost her job, her friends have been harassed by N.C.A.A. investigators and it has affected her health. She blames herself for her son’s problems, even though, by any reasonable standard, she did nothing wrong. I hear that she cries a lot these days.\n",
      "On Sunday afternoon, Osburn issued one last statement on behalf of the N.C.A.A. Responding to Tompsett’s statement, she claimed the initial N.C.A.A. press release was necessary to combat “inaccurate reporting,” and that it hadn’t violated the Boatrights’ privacy. She concluded with one last cheap shot at Tanesha: “Had Ms. Boatright cooperated fully from the beginning, this matter could have been settled months ago.”\n",
      "Thus does the N.C.A.A. protect the sanctity of amateurism and the purity of college athletics.\n",

      "Stephen Colbert teasing South Carolina about a run for the presidency is becoming one of America’s great political traditions, right up there with awkward photographs of candidates eating corn dogs at the Iowa State Fair.\n",
      "On Thursday night he said he was setting up an exploratory committee after a Public Policy Polling survey put him ahead of the Republican presidential hopeful Jon M. Huntsman Jr. In 2007 Mr. Colbert made even more elaborate forays into a possible candidacy during the Democratic primaries, outpolling Bill Richardson, the governor of New Mexico at the time, and Christopher J. Dodd, the senator from Connecticut. He didn’t get on the ballot then, and he won’t this year. (He missed the Nov. 1 deadline, and South Carolina doesn’t provide a space for write-in candidates.) But of course that’s not the point. His latest presidential flirtation is an attempt at something even more ambitious: making campaign-finance laws funny.\n",
      "By putting Jon Stewart in charge of his “super” political action committee, renamed the Definitely Not Coordinating With Stephen Colbert Super PAC, Mr. Colbert provides a study in the absurdity of laws governing campaign spending. It’s what’s fresh about a Colbert joke that seems a little tired on the second go-round. We’ve seen these elaborate teases and the celebratory balloons before. Then again, the potential (and unpredictability) of Mr. Colbert’s stunt derives from his uncanny ability to draw the rest of the world into his comic conceits.\n",
      "Seeing poor Mr. Huntsman’s face on Fox News after he was asked about trailing Mr. Colbert, a former Second City performer, made for delightful cringe humor. And the media attention is an incredible spectacle. Last time Mr. Colbert did so many news programs (he was on “Meet the Press,” for heaven’s sake) that there was even a media backlash inspiring another wave of reports.\n",
      "Now he is starting the cycle again: he is scheduled to appear on “This Week With George Stephanopoulos” on Sunday morning. Even writing this column shows how I’ve become part of his joke, which is expanding into the media landscape the way the Blob attacked a small town.\n",
      "This all makes you realize something that has been a longtime thematic undercurrent of “The Colbert Report”: Mr. Colbert is a serious performer playing a silly character, while the media and political world are deeply silly but pretending to be serious. That was never more clearly illustrated than in the most triumphant part of his show on Thursday, when the respected Politico writer Mike Allen offered a (mock?) serious analysis of his prospects, citing polls and strategy. With little prompting, he started game-planning the nonexistent and probably never existent campaign, becoming part of the joke as well. The journalist Joshua Green played a similar cameo role last election.\n",
      "You’ve heard of fantasy baseball? This is fantasy politics. And it’s perfectly suited to a cycle in which journalists spent weeks obsessing over the political future of the host of “The Apprentice.” Incidentally, one of the funniest moments in the current campaign occurred when Rick Santorum told Politico that he would not draft a player on his fantasy baseball team who is a known steroid user. (I want to be in his league!)\n",
      "The most remarkable thing about prominent political journalists speculating about a fake candidate is that it seems so normal now. What makes Mr. Colbert such an ingenious satirist is not just that he exposes political fantasy but that he also takes it to its illogical conclusion. After all, the first issue ad that he made with “funds” from his super PAC starred a theoretically real candidate, Buddy Roemer, standing on a fake set with fake books, and ended with Mr. Colbert on a unicorn proclaiming, “To Narnia!”\n",

      "AS the hour of actual caucusing drew closer, Ron Paul’s campaign trumpeted his endorsement by a pastor who, as it happens, has spoken of executing homosexuals. Rick Perry pledged to devote predator drones and thousands of troops to the protection of the Mexican border, making the mission to keep every last illegal immigrant from crossing sound as urgent as rooting out terrorists in Pakistan.\n",
      "And Rick Santorum, bringing his “Faith, Family and Freedom” tour to this eastern Iowa town on Thursday, promised never to be cowed by all those craven secularists who believe that a stable, healthy household needn’t be headed by a God-fearing mom and dad.\n",
      "None of these three men is likely to win the Republican nomination. But before they exit stage right — stage far right, that is — they and a few of their similarly quixotic, similarly strident competitors will do no small measure of damage to the Republican Party and no great favors to the country as a whole. What happens in Iowa doesn’t stay in Iowa: it befouls Republicans’ image nationally, becomes a millstone around the eventual nominee’s neck and legitimizes debate about some matters that shouldn’t be debatable.\n",
      "The run-up to the Iowa caucuses, like the rest of the primary season thus far, has underscored just how much general nuttiness and moral extremism the party has come to accommodate, with Iowa serving as a theater of the conservative absurd. The state’s unrepresentative caucuses — in which a mere 100,000 or so of the most fervent voters, almost all of them white, are expected to participate — coax a Bible-thumping, border-militarizing harshness from candidates that’s a tonal turnoff to the swing voters who will probably decide the general election.\n",
      "The more reasoned, practical members of the Republican establishment know this. That’s why many of them are doing all they can to expedite the coronation of Mitt Romney, whose mild manner and time as the governor of a heavily Democratic state give him a centrist aura, or at least the possibility of one. They’d like to get his loopier and more incendiary rivals away from the television cameras, soon.\n",
      "Many Democrats take heart from the spectacle of ultra-conservative pandering in Iowa, correctly surmising that it bolsters their own party’s fortunes and President Obama’s re-election chances. They shouldn’t, not if they care about the country, best served by a vigorous back-and-forth about the proper size and role of government and about budgetary restraint. In its least hypocritical moments, the Republican Party has provided an important counterbalance to a Democratic tropism toward paternalism and bloat. It can’t do that if it marginalizes itself by repelling fiscally conservative but socially moderate voters who have little appetite for the shenanigans in Iowa.\n",
      "Last week, Paul remained at or near the top of polls of the state’s Republicans, despite his refusal to disavow support from white supremacist and anti-Zionist groups and — on an infinitely lighter note — a campaign style that just won’t cut it.\n",
      "I caught up with him in Newton, where his staff distributed glossy pamphlets, “The Ron Paul Family Cookbook,” with recipes for “cherry-pineapple dump cake,” “impossible pie,” “razzle bo-dazzle pork tenderloin” and more. His remarks were less sculptured stump speech than meandering civics seminar, with none of the customary oratorical swells and dips.\n",
      "An advocate of abolishing the Federal Reserve, he got questions unlike those other candidates receive, including one about monetary policy that concluded, “My thought is: maybe the silver standard?” He responded by earnestly weighing silver against gold, the pol as metallurgist.\n",
      "He terrifies more pragmatic conservatives like the commentator Michael Medved, who has called him “Dr. Demento.” Medved wrote in The Daily Beast last week that a strong showing by Paul in the caucuses and beyond would be “disastrous to Republican prospects,” validating the impression that “today’s Republicans have become a wild and crazy bunch, harboring oddball, irresponsible notions that place them far outside the American mainstream and make them untrustworthy when it comes to the serious business of governance.” He added, rightly, that Paul’s associations aren’t helpful to a party whose future may depend on its appeal to Hispanic and black voters.\n",

      "THERE are 16 shots in Lars von Trier ’s hauntingly beautiful overture to “Melancholia,” a movie about love, family and the apocalypse. The movie, among Mr. von Trier’s greatest, stars Kirsten Dunst as Justine, a young advertising copywriter who, shortly after she gets married endures two separate yet related catastrophes: A wedding party at an oceanside golf resort owned by her brother-in-law ends with her new husband leaving. This in turn brings on the depression that overtakes her and seems to inaugurate the end of the world or her dream of the same. Many of the movie’s themes are introduced in the first eight minutes, a masterpiece in miniature that is a palimpsest of literary, artistic and cinematic allusions.\n",
      "1A. The movie opens with a fade from black to a close-up of Justine’s head, with a bit of her neck. Her eyes are closed, and her head is slightly to the left of the center of the frame, with the rest of the image taken up by a gray-white sky streaked with pink. She slowly opens her eyes, her gaze directed at the camera (and us), her face impassive. As soon as her eyes are opened, dead birds begin falling from the sky like stones, an intimation of the disaster(s) to come.\n",
      "1B. On the soundtrack the exquisite prelude to Wagner’s opera, “Tristan and Isolde” (completed 1859), begins to play. Wagner described the opera as “one of endless yearning, longing, the bliss and wretchedness of love; world, power, fame, honor, chivalry, loyalty and friendship all blown away like an insubstantial dream,” for which there is “one sole redemption — death, finality, a sleep without awakening.”\n",
      "1C. Ms. Dunst’s character shares her name with the title figure in the Marquis de Sade’s 1787 novel “Justine,” about a virtuous woman who endures a crucible of suffering and, after being reunited with her sister, Juliette, is fatally struck by lightning. Mr. von Trier has expressed interest in adapting the novel, and it was one of the inspirations for his 1996 feature, “Breaking the Waves,” in which Emily Watson plays a doomed, sexually exploited, saintlike figure. “In the end,” Mr. von Trier said in a 1996 interview, “Justine thanks God for his goodness in letting her survive all the calamities — after which she is struck by lightning and burns to death.”\n",
      "2. A long, overhead shot of a green lawn flanked by two parallel rows of teardrop-shaped bushes, a stretch of water at the top of the shot and a large sundial centered at the bottom. The shot evokes the famous garden in Alain Resnais’s “Last Year at Marienbad” (1961) with its topiary, statues and human figures, which alone cast shadows. Of Mr. Resnais’s work the novelist and filmmaker Alain Robbe-Grillet, who wrote “Marienbad,” said: “In it I recognized my own efforts toward a somewhat ritual deliberation, a certain slowness, a sense of the theatrical, even that occasional rigidity of attitude,” which, he added, “suggests both a statue and an opera.” This fits “Melancholia” too.\n",
      "3. A shot of the painting “Hunters in the Snow” by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, which here burns and shows up again when Justine replaces a book of modern paintings on a shelf with a book that has a reproduction of the Bruegel. The painting also appears in Andrei Tarkovsky’s 1972 film “Solaris,” including in a scene in which the dead wife of the lead character — or rather his hallucination of her — looks at the painting before the two of them levitate in each other’s arms, as a Bach choral prelude plays. Later the husband will walk through a wintery landscape that resembles that in the painting. “There’s no doubt that Tarkovsky,” Mr. von Trier has said, “is the master of them all.”\n",
      "4. This shot shows a blue planet, perhaps Earth, seen from outer space, with a red pinprick to its right. This red point turns out to be planet Melancholia, which gives the movie its title and is hurtling toward Earth on an apparent collision course. Within the frame the blue planet is situated in the same location as Justine’s head is in the first shot and both her head and the planet are roughly the same size, which suggests an affinity between the two. One possibility: the world of the movie is nothing other than a manifestation of Justine’s imagination (head). This planetary vision — along with three others in the prelude — encapsulates the movie’s in broad outline.\n",
      "5. A woman we later learn is Justine’s sister, Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg ), holds her son, Leo, in her arms. She’s walking or perhaps trying to run on a hilly golf course, a line of deep, black footsteps trailing behind her. The artificial quality of the light illuminating this night scene along with the enveloping sense of threat recalls the elaborately staged and spectral landscapes in the work of the contemporary photographer Gregory Crewdson, whose influences include the filmmakers David Lynch and Steven Spielberg. Mr. Crewdson has described his photographs as “about the moment of transition between before and after.” The images in Mr. von Trier’s prelude have a similar liminal quality in that each refers to an extracted narrative moment, and in-between feelings, sensations, gestures.\n",
      "6. A long shot of a saddled horse falling back on its hind legs. This shot prefigures two critical scenes, one in which Justine rides her favorite horse, Abraham, and viciously kicks and beats him with a crop when he refuses to cross a bridge separating the estate from the outside world. Abraham makes another important appearance when Claire sends him off, saddled without a rider, to create a diversion. (The image of a riderless horse is an elegiac one, evoking military and state funerals, including that of John F. Kennedy.) The horse’s name of course also suggests the biblical patriarch who bargains with God to try and save Sodom and Gomorrah from destruction. (He fails.)\n",
      "7. Justine, in long shot, stands in the center of a clearing surrounded by forest, her arms stretched out, like Jesus, as flurries of white insects float in the night sky. (“For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.” Isaiah 51:8)\n",
      "8. An extreme long shot of Justine in her bridal gown standing parallel with Leo and Claire. All three face the camera and stand at more than an arm’s distance from one another, the estate mansion looming behind them. The night sky is brightened by light from the moon and Melancholia, which are also lined up in a row.\n",
      "9. Another outer-space shot, this one of a half-obscured blue planet moving away from a smaller, equally obscured red planet. The blue planet looks as if it is trying to escape the smaller planet.\n",
      "10. A medium shot of Justine on the golf course facing the camera and raising her bent arms. Wearing a short-sleeved shirt she gazes at her splayed fingers on one hand as small zigzags of lightening begin to shoot from their tips. In the background, against the gray sky, bolts of lightning shoot from what look like light poles.\n",
      "11. Justine, seen in profile and in long shot, trudges through a forest glade in her wedding dress and veil, long skeins of what look like Spanish moss or seaweed wrapped around her ankles and trailing behind her. She leans forward, as if she were moving with difficulty. These dark tendrils probably refer to the wool that she later mentions when she describes her feelings of woe to Claire. Similar looking tendrils float from the surrounding tree, as if Justine is one with nature.\n",
      "12. In the prelude’s third outer-space tableau, two partially seen planets — one reddish-brown, one blue — move toward each other and touch as delicately as if they were kissing, an encounter that recalls the link between desire and death.\n",
      "13. An interior shot — the only one in the prelude — of a windowed alcove with bench seating. There are no people or animals in the shot, but one of the manicured garden bushes, consumed in flames, can be seen through the windows. In the Book of Exodus, the burning bush is where Moses is directed by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. The burning bush is a familiar subject in religious art, and also appears before Charlton Heston, as Moses, in “The Ten Commandments” (1956).\n",
      "14. An impassive Justine, seen in a medium shot facing the camera, floats down a narrow stream, plants and her veil fanning around her. In her hands she holds a bridal bouquet of lilies of the valley, also known as Eve’s Tears for those Eve shed as she was expelled from Eden. Here Justine evokes Ophelia, who in the throes of grief over Hamlet, drowns. “Her clothes spread wide; and, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up,” the Queen says in “Hamlet,” in describing the death. “Drown’d, drown’d.”\n",
      "15. A nocturnal forest tableau with Leo whittling a long stick with a blade on the left side of the image while Justine walks toward the camera on the right. Later sticks like these will be used by Leo and Justine to build the fragile teepee turned funeral pyre in which they and Claire sit as Melancholia hurtles toward them.\n",
      "16. In the last space shot — and the final image in the prelude — a small planet moves from left to right toward a much larger planet, which seems to pull the small globe closer with translucent rays as if in an apocalyptic embrace.\n",

      "THE Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index returned nothing in 2011, but a lost year overshadowed a late rally. Managers of three of the fourth quarter’s better-performing mutual funds found winners in such varied places as small-capitalization stocks , auto parts retailers and aerospace companies.\n",
      "Buying What They Like\n",
      "Robert E. Killen and Lee S. Grout, co-managers of the Berwyn Fund, call themselves contrarians but might be better termed investment agnostics, as they pay little attention to such orthodoxies as benchmarks and broad diversification. Instead, they buy what they like, sector weightings be damned. If they find themselves with, say, lots of industrial stocks, so be it. They just want companies — typically about 40 — that meet their quality screens.\n",
      "“We own a collection of really good businesses,” Mr. Grout said. “Beyond that, there’s no grand plan.” Their fund, which holds mainly small-capitalization stocks, carries an expense ratio of 1.26 percent and returned 19.7 percent in the fourth quarter.\n",
      "Lately, Mr. Killen and Mr. Grout’s willingness to go where other investors won’t has led them to Winnebago Industries, the motor home maker. When they invested, the stock had sagged for fear that high gasoline prices and a soft economy would sap sales. Prices for the company’s campers start at about $70,000 and climb to more than $300,000, and the weak economy had driven several competitors to bankruptcy. But Winnebago, which carries no debt, was protected by its well-known brand and sturdy financials, Mr. Killen said.\n",
      "One unifying factor in the portfolio is its companies’ distaste for debt. Mr. Killen and Mr. Grout prefer businesses that can finance their own expansions and acquisitions and don’t have to rely on the capital markets, particularly in times of stress.\n",
      "In Search of Fortresses\n",
      "Eric S. Ende, co-manager of FPA Paramount, also favors companies with the financial wherewithal to endure tough times — or, as he terms them, those with “fortress balance sheets.” His fund, which carries an expense ratio of 0.93 percent, returned 16.7 percent for the quarter.\n",
      "Mr. Ende ranges wider than Mr. Killen and Mr. Grout in hunting for investments. His fund owns both small- and mid-cap companies, and he lately has put a growing portion of the portfolio abroad. In 2011, Paramount’s parent, First Pacific Advisors in Los Angeles, announced that the fund would gradually increase its foreign stake and would eventually invest more than half its assets in companies based outside the United States. Its foreign holdings stood at 12.5 percent on Sept. 30, the most recent data available.\n",
      "That transition may not happen quickly, because of Mr. Ende’s penchant for sticking with stocks. He sells only about 10 percent of the fund’s holdings annually. His largest holding, O’Reilly Automotive, the auto parts retailer, has been in the fund since 1998.\n",
      "But he has been adding names from outside the United States. A recent addition is L’Occitane, the French cosmetics company. Mr. Ende liked its broad reach, with sales in Europe, Asia and the United States, as well as its control over its supplies and distribution. L’Occitane buys raw materials, like lavender, directly from farmers in the Provence region of France and owns many of its retail outlets.\n",
      "Mr. Ende seeks out well-run companies, rather than betting on sectors or macroeconomic trends, but he does have one sector-specific rule: he shuns banks and insurers.\n",
      "“If you own a bank or an insurance company, you basically don’t know what’s in its portfolio, and you have to depend on your warm, fuzzy feelings about management,” he said. “And then, every 10 years, you find that they blow up.” That happened with the recent real estate crash but also with earlier debacles like the Latin American debt crisis and the savings-and-loan scandal in the United States.\n",
      "Jets, Robots and Profits\n",
      "Like the managers of Berwyn and FPA Paramount, John S. Sheehy of the Fidelity Select Defense and Aerospace Portfolio pores over financial statements to winnow candidates for investment. It’s a discipline for which he’s well trained: before managing money, he was a certified public accountant, working as an auditor in the New York and Boston offices of Deloitte.\n",
      "Mr. Sheehy’s fund, which carries an expense ratio of 0.88 percent, returned 12.7 percent for the quarter.\n",
      "Lately, the military and aerospace sectors have felt headwinds: United States military spending is falling, and high fuel prices are cutting into airline profits. But Mr. Sheehy has managed to find winning stocks among obvious names, like Boeing, and lesser-known ones, like iRobot.\n",
      "Boeing, the fund’s second-largest holding, behind United Technologies, accounted for 13.66 percent of assets on Nov. 30, the most recent reporting date. The stock has risen thanks to strong orders for its commercial jets, Mr. Sheehy said. In December, for example, Southwest Airlines announced that it would buy 208 more of Boeing’s 737 jets.\n",
      "On top of that, international carriers are lining up for Boeing’s newest offering, the 787, he said. Airlines in Moscow and Abu Dhabi placed orders in December.\n",
      "Like Boeing, iRobot splits its business between commercial products and gear designed for the Defense Department and similar buyers. Perhaps its best-known offerings are its robotic vacuum cleaner, the Roomba, and its robotic mop, the Scooba. But the company, based in Bedford, Mass., also makes small robots for military uses like bomb disposal and surveillance. It even makes a maritime robot — think of it as a tiny submarine — that does ocean surveillance.\n",
      "Mr. Sheehy prefers companies, like these two, that don’t depend only on military spending for their revenue. He looks for ones with sales split between public and private clients or those that sell to the militaries of a variety of countries.\n",
      "His fund tends to hew to domestic companies. Partly, that’s an outgrowth of the size of the military budget in a period when the United States maintained large armed presences in both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n",
      "Despite the budget-cutting under consideration, the United States is still likely to account for much of the world’s military spending, he said.\n",

      "How goes the state of the union? Well, the state of the economy remains terrible. Three years after President Obama’s inauguration and two and a half years since the official end of the recession, unemployment remains painfully high.\n",
      "But there are reasons to think that we’re finally on the (slow) road to better times. And we wouldn’t be on that road if Mr. Obama had given in to Republican demands that he slash spending, or the Federal Reserve had given in to Republican demands that it tighten money.\n",
      "Why am I letting a bit of optimism break through the clouds? Recent economic data have been a bit better, but we’ve already had several false dawns on that front. More important, there’s evidence that the two great problems at the root of our slump — the housing bust and excessive private debt — are finally easing.\n",
      "On housing: as everyone now knows (but oh, the abuse heaped on anyone pointing it out while it was happening!), we had a monstrous housing bubble between 2000 and 2006. Home prices soared, and there was clearly a lot of overbuilding. When the bubble burst, construction — which had been the economy’s main driver during the alleged “Bush boom” — plunged.\n",
      "But the bubble began deflating almost six years ago; house prices are back to 2003 levels. And after a protracted slump in housing starts, America now looks seriously underprovided with houses, at least by historical standards.\n",
      "So why aren’t people going out and buying? Because the depressed state of the economy leaves many people who would normally be buying homes either unable to afford them or too worried about job prospects to take the risk.\n",
      "But the economy is depressed, in large part, because of the housing bust, which immediately suggests the possibility of a virtuous circle: an improving economy leads to a surge in home purchases, which leads to more construction, which strengthens the economy further, and so on. And if you squint hard at recent data, it looks as if something like that may be starting: home sales are up, unemployment claims are down, and builders’ confidence is rising.\n",
      "Furthermore, the chances for a virtuous circle have been rising, because we’ve made significant progress on the debt front.\n",
      "That’s not what you hear in public debate, of course, where all the focus is on rising government debt. But anyone who has looked seriously at how we got into this slump knows that private debt, especially household debt, was the real culprit: it was the explosion of household debt during the Bush years that set the stage for the crisis. And the good news is that this private debt has declined in dollar terms, and declined substantially as a percentage of G.D.P., since the end of 2008.\n",
      "There are, of course, still big risks — above all, the risk that trouble in Europe could derail our own incipient recovery. And thereby hangs a tale — a tale told by a recent report from the McKinsey Global Institute.\n",
      "The report tracks progress on “deleveraging,” the process of bringing down excessive debt levels. It documents substantial progress in the United States, which it contrasts with failure to make progress in Europe. And while the report doesn’t say this explicitly, it’s pretty clear why Europe is doing worse than we are: it’s because European policy makers have been afraid of the wrong things.\n",
      "In particular, the European Central Bank has been worrying about inflation — even raising interest rates during 2011, only to reverse course later in the year — rather than worrying about how to sustain economic recovery. And fiscal austerity, which is supposed to limit the increase in government debt, has depressed the economy, making it impossible to achieve urgently needed reductions in private debt. The end result is that for all their moralizing about the evils of borrowing, the Europeans aren’t making any progress against excessive debt — whereas we are.\n",
      "Back to the U.S. situation: my guarded optimism should not be taken as a statement that all is well. We have already suffered enormous, unnecessary damage because of an inadequate response to the slump. We have failed to provide significant mortgage relief, which could have moved us much more quickly to lower debt. And even if my hoped-for virtuous circle is getting under way, it will be years before we get to anything resembling full employment.\n",
      "But things could have been worse; they would have been worse if we had followed the policies demanded by Mr. Obama’s opponents. For as I said at the beginning, Republicans have been demanding that the Fed stop trying to bring down interest rates and that federal spending be slashed immediately — which amounts to demanding that we emulate Europe’s failure.\n",
      "And if this year’s election brings the wrong ideology to power, America’s nascent recovery might well be snuffed out.\n",

      "The first Haitian to get cholera at the onset of the 2010 epidemic was almost undoubtedly a 28-year-old mentally disturbed man from the town of Mirebalais, researchers reported Monday.\n",
      "The man, whose name was not revealed in the report, in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, was known as the village “moun fou” — Creole for “crazy person” — said the authors, who work for Partners in Health, a Boston group associated with Dr. Paul E. Farmer that has provided free health care in Haiti since 1987.\n",
      "Although his family had clean drinking water, the man often walked naked through town to bathe and drink from the Latem River just downstream from the Meye River, into which raw sewage drained from an encampment of United Nations peacekeepers from Nepal.\n",
      "Haiti’s outbreak was of a Nepali strain, and that encampment is considered the source.\n",
      "The man developed severe diarrhea on Oct. 12, 2010, and died in less than 24 hours. Two people who washed his body for a wake fell ill 48 hours later. Haiti’s first hospitalized cholera case was in Mirebalais on Oct. 17.\n",
      "The epidemic has since sickened nearly 500,000 people across Haiti and killed nearly 7,000.\n",
      "The man’s habits made him the first known victim, said Dr. Louise C. Ivers, one of the new report’s authors. But because of the “infamous living situation” in Mirebalais, which is desperately poor and was swollen with refugees from the devastating earthquake nine months earlier, the epidemic was inevitable.\n",

      "CENTENNIAL, Colo. — For Missy Franklin, the snowstorm that immobilized this city last Friday seemed heaven-sent. Housebound by nearly 20 inches of snow, Franklin reread the third book in “The Hunger Games” trilogy, completed her physics and English homework, watched “The Sound of Music,” texted with friends and took turns cuddling on the couch with her mother and father.\n",
      "It was as if Mother Nature called a timeout to give Franklin a respite from a blizzard of attention that shows no signs of abating.\n",
      "At the United States Olympic swimming trials in June, Franklin, 16, will be a favorite to make the team for the London Games. After a five-medal performance at the world championships in Shanghai last summer, she is expected to contend for multiple Olympic medals. But first, she will represent Regis Jesuit, the reigning champion, at the 5A state high school and diving championships in Fort Collins, Colo., on Friday and Saturday.\n",
      "When Franklin won two individual events at last weekend’s league meet, the state meet felt the ripple effect. Tickets for the preliminary and finals sessions at the Edora Pool Ice Center, which seats roughly 1,000, quickly sold out. A line for the remaining tickets is expected to form outside in the freezing cold several hours before Friday’s 4 p.m. preliminaries and Saturday’s 2 p.m. finals. The meet will be carried by ESPN3 and covered by state and national media outlets.\n",
      "Franklin, who is 6 feet 1 inch, with pale skin, long brown hair and a smile that never dims, is at once a pacesetter and a throwback, her high school participation akin to a grandmaster showing up at Central Park to play a few games of speed chess.\n",
      "“A lot of people think of swimming as an individual sport, but I’ve always loved the team aspect,” Franklin said.\n",
      "Michael Phelps, to whom the versatile Franklin often is compared, turned pro 11 years ago when he was 16, forsaking the chance to compete in high school and college to sign endorsement deals that made him an instant millionaire.\n",
      "Franklin so far has turned down roughly $150,000 in prize money and untold riches in sponsorships for the privilege of swimming alongside and against girls who cannot keep up with her. In the 100-yard backstroke, she is eight seconds faster than her next best teammate and almost three seconds faster than her closest in-state rival.\n",
      "During a four-day stretch of FINA World Cup short-course races in Europe last fall, Franklin won seven events and set a world record in the 200-meter backstroke. She would have left Europe with $73,000 if she had been able to accept prize money.\n",
      "A quick economics lesson delivered by her parents, Dick and D. A., did little to sway Franklin, who also wants to swim in college. Her father, Dick, a regional director of a clean-technologies company, pointed out that her mother, D. A., a physician, did not earn in all of 2011 what Franklin might have pocketed in less than a week of racing in Europe.\n",
      "“It was definitely a hard conversation for me to hear,” Franklin said. “I don’t think about money the same way my parents do.”\n",
      "She added, “Even after going through that conversation, for me, I couldn’t put a price on swimming in high school.”\n",
      "To the consternation of some people connected with United States Swimming, Franklin is missing an Olympic trials tune-up meet in a 50-meter pool in Missouri this weekend to swim at the state meet, which will be in a 25-yard pool.\n",
      "“If I just focused on the Olympics 24/7, it’s going to add so much pressure,” Franklin said. “It’s additional thoughts that just aren’t needed.”\n",
      "When her high school coach, Nick Frasersmith, was completing the state meet entries, he asked Franklin which events she wished to race. She had qualified in the 50, 100 and 200 freestyles, the 100 backstroke and the 200 individual medley. She told him to put her in whichever events he thought would help the team the most. So he entered Franklin in the 200 freestyle and 100 backstroke. She will also swim two relays.\n",
      "Franklin’s best friend and Regis Jesuit classmate, Abby Cutler, said she believed that Franklin, an only child, embraced high school swimming because it leaves her with the best of both worlds: parents who dote on her at home and a dedicated sisterhood at school.\n",
      "Franklin mentioned tie-dye parties and inside jokes that are wrung for laughs for months and the songs she mischievously compiles on a CD that get stuck in her teammates’ heads. “That’s the thing I’m best at,” she said, beaming.\n",
      "Cutler said that when she surpassed the state qualifying standards in the 200 and 500 freestyles, the first person who called to congratulate her was Franklin.\n",
      "“She was just as excited for me as we were for her when she set the world record,” Cutler said.\n",

      "It’s usually a bad sign when you hear people in a theater audience talking more about the set than anything else during the intermission. But that would be the wrong conclusion to draw about the Two River Theater Company ’s vibrant new production of August Wilson ’s “Jitney.”\n",
      "Yes, Neil Patel’s set is convincingly realistic: the dingy office of a Pittsburgh gypsy cab company, circa 1977, with two midcentury cars parked just beyond the dirty windows upstage. But the soul of “Jitney,” like that of almost all of Wilson’s work, is in the words. And one overwhelming reaction to this production has to be a renewed sense of loss at his death.\n",
      "Wilson was just 60, in 2005, when he died of liver cancer. Heaven knows how many more outstanding works of cultural poetry he might have produced in another decade or two. But theatergoers are fortunate that he had finished his cycle of 10 plays about the 20th-century African-American experience, each set in a different decade.\n",
      "The cycle began with “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” which hit Broadway in 1984, and ended with “Radio Golf,” which opened at Yale Repertory Theater in Connecticut five months before he died. In between, he wrote, among other things, “Joe Turner’s Come and Gone” and two Pulitzer Prize winners, “Fences,” for which Denzel Washington and Viola Davis won Tony Awards during its Broadway revival in 2010, and “The Piano Lesson.”\n",
      "“Jitney” is set, like most of the 20th-century cycle, in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, where Wilson lived as a child. Until the end of the play, the only all-encompassing plot point is that the cab company’s building is going to be demolished by the city to make room for new construction. The boss, Becker (Chuck Cooper), must decide whether to take a stand and fight City Hall, look for a new place or close up shop. A subplot is provided by the impending arrival of Becker’s son, Booster (J. Bernard Calloway), who is returning home after 20 years in prison, a fact that is taken very casually by the employees.\n",
      "The script’s most telling detail may be the absence of an office telephone. The drivers take their calls on a pay phone — because, happily, incoming calls are free.\n",
      "The men who hang around the jitney office, mostly the drivers, are identifiable types, but they are never caricatures. Still, most can be described in a sound bite. Fielding (Anthony Chisholm) is a drunk; we find him stretched out on the sofa in the first scene. Turnbo (Allie Woods Jr.) is a troublemaker, who carries a gun that he draws and aims with very little provocation, frightening his friends accordingly. Youngblood (Brandon J. Dirden), as his name suggests, is the youngest man in the group and something of a hothead.\n",
      "We probably owe the show’s velvety smooth progression to the numerous rewrites and restagings done since “Jitney” was written in the late ’70s and first produced, in Pittsburgh, in 1982. In this production, much credit also goes to Ruben Santiago-Hudson, who directed. Who knows how he found time to do this? Best known as an actor (on television he played a police captain for three seasons of ABC’s “Castle”), Mr. Santiago-Hudson has been appearing on Broadway as the patriarch in the family drama “Stick Fly” since November. He is clearly an outstanding interpreter of Wilson’s work, having won a Tony for his featured role in “Seven Guitars” in 1996.\n",
      "The nine actors Mr. Santiago-Hudson works with here give assured, deeply affectionate performances (although I think I heard a few false starts on lines here and there). They comfortably make Wilson’s lyrical language their own, but then who wouldn’t want to claim lines like “Women and money get a preacher killed”?\n",
      "Only one woman appears in “Jitney.” Roslyn Ruff, as Youngblood’s wife, Rena, has a memorable scene in which she explains to her well-meaning husband that while many women may enjoy surprises, they should probably arrive in the form of flowers and candy and the like. She says, “Don’t surprise me with a house” — after he has done just that.\n",

      "Unsure where to turn, he headed home to Stamford.\n",
      "“I had $9,000 in the bank, didn’t own a car, didn’t own a house and didn’t know what I was going to do,” Valentine said last week, looking back on the conclusion of his decade in the big leagues.\n",
      "The Yankees offered a lifeline, asking the 29-year-old Valentine to manage their minor league team in Oneonta, N.Y. His friends in baseball, not to mention George Steinbrenner, were surprised when Valentine declined.\n",

      "This week, as Valentine takes his first steps as the new manager of the Boston Red Sox, a daring venture that will elevate him to a pronounced spotlight at the age of 61, it is easy to think of the smiling, polished Bobby V as a man who always possessed a confident vision of a baseball future full of bright lights and fame.\n",
      "In fact, by the fall of 1979, Valentine had begun selling life insurance and was studying for his real estate license.\n",
      "“People would ask me, ‘Is this what you’re going to do with yourself?’ ” Valentine said in a two-hour interview as he drove from Fenway Park to a charity function in Connecticut last week. “And I would answer, ‘I have no idea.’ ”\n",
      "Baseball, for sure, seemed far from the picture.\n",
      "“Everything that happened after 1979 was just luck,” Valentine said. “I stayed in Stamford and I got lucky.”\n",
      "One of the annual, celebrated functions in Stamford, a city of 120,000 about 35 miles northeast of Manhattan, is a dinner benefiting muscular dystrophy. Late in 1979, Valentine’s boyhood friend Rick Robustelli, son of the former football Giants Hall of Famer Andy Robustelli, had been given extra tickets to the dinner. He invited Valentine and his wife of two years, Mary, to accompany him.\n",
      "Across the dinner table from the Valentines was one of Robustelli’s neighbors, Joe Romano, a Stamford businessman. He asked Valentine about his next career move, and Bobby gave his standard nonanswer.\n",
      "“He asked me if I ever thought about opening a restaurant, maybe a sports bar,” Valentine said. “And pretty much the next day we became partners in the restaurant business, which people later told me was the riskiest thing I could have done.”\n",
      "Riskier still, Valentine and Romano chose to take over a troubled, existing beer-and-brawl bar in one of Stamford’s seediest sections — across the street from a small triangular-shaped park known for its drug and prostitution trade.\n",
      "“People in town thought he was crazy,” said Bill Arnone, another Valentine childhood friend. “Nobody would come down to that neighborhood. You wouldn’t even slow your car down as you passed by.”\n",
      "For the next several weeks, Valentine’s father, Joseph, a carpenter, rebuilt the inside of the bar as Bobby hauled lumber and other materials through the back door. Valentine, who had played in Los Angeles, Anaheim, San Diego, Seattle and New York, had an idea for what the modern, late-20th-century sports bar should look like.\n",
      "It would have 10 or 12 televisions positioned throughout the bar in an era when many bars had one or two at most. Every wall would be splashed with sports memorabilia; Valentine was a big collector. The bar top itself would be glass, and beneath it would be hundreds of old baseball cards, another novelty. Most innovative, above the bar was a new service being sold: a sports ticker with a running stream of updated scores from around the country.\n",
      "It may sound like the standard description of a sports bar now, but in 1980 it was almost revolutionary.\n",
      "Still, there was the blighted area all around Bobby V’s Sports Gallery Cafe.\n",
      "One night, Valentine slipped into a lounge in another part of Stamford and heard the patrons talking about his bar.\n",
      "“It will be three years before any woman steps foot in the place,” the bartender said.\n",

      "LORAIN, Ohio — It used to be called illegitimacy. Now it is the new normal. After steadily rising for five decades, the share of children born to unmarried women has crossed a threshold: more than half of births to American women under 30 occur outside marriage.\n",
      "Once largely limited to poor women and minorities, motherhood without marriage has settled deeply into middle America. The fastest growth in the last two decades has occurred among white women in their 20s who have some college education but no four-year degree, according to Child Trends, a Washington research group that analyzed government data.\n",
      "Among mothers of all ages, a majority — 59 percent in 2009 — are married when they have children. But the surge of births outside marriage among younger women — nearly two-thirds of children in the United States are born to mothers under 30 — is both a symbol of the transforming family and a hint of coming generational change.\n",
      "One group still largely resists the trend: college graduates, who overwhelmingly marry before having children. That is turning family structure into a new class divide, with the economic and social rewards of marriage increasingly reserved for people with the most education.\n",
      "“Marriage has become a luxury good,” said Frank Furstenberg, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania.\n",
      "The shift is affecting children’s lives. Researchers have consistently found that children born outside marriage face elevated risks of falling into poverty, failing in school or suffering emotional and behavioral problems.\n",
      "The forces rearranging the family are as diverse as globalization and the pill. Liberal analysts argue that shrinking paychecks have thinned the ranks of marriageable men, while conservatives often say that the sexual revolution reduced the incentive to wed and that safety net programs discourage marriage.\n",
      "Here in Lorain, a blue-collar town west of Cleveland where the decline of the married two-parent family has been especially steep, dozens of interviews with young parents suggest that both sides have a point.\n",
      "Over the past generation, Lorain lost most of two steel mills, a shipyard and a Ford factory, diminishing the supply of jobs that let blue-collar workers raise middle-class families. More women went to work, making marriage less of a financial necessity for them. Living together became routine, and single motherhood lost the stigma that once sent couples rushing to the altar. Women here often describe marriage as a sign of having arrived rather than a way to get there.\n",
      "Meanwhile, children happen.\n",
      "Amber Strader, 27, was in an on-and-off relationship with a clerk at Sears a few years ago when she found herself pregnant. A former nursing student who now tends bar, Ms. Strader said her boyfriend was so dependent that she had to buy his cigarettes. Marrying him never entered her mind. “It was like living with another kid,” she said.\n",
      "When a second child, with a new boyfriend, followed three years later — her birth control failed, she said — her boyfriend, a part-time house painter, was reluctant to wed.\n",
      "Ms. Strader likes the idea of marriage; she keeps her parents’ wedding photo on her kitchen wall and says her boyfriend is a good father. But for now marriage is beyond her reach.\n",
      "“I’d like to do it, but I just don’t see it happening right now,” she said. “Most of my friends say it’s just a piece of paper, and it doesn’t work out anyway.”\n",
      "The recent rise in single motherhood has set off few alarms, unlike in past eras. When Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then a top Labor Department official and later a United States senator from New York, reported in 1965 that a quarter of black children were born outside marriage — and warned of a “tangle of pathology” — he set off a bitter debate.\n",
      "By the mid-1990s, such figures looked quaint: a third of Americans were born outside marriage. Congress, largely blaming welfare, imposed tough restrictions. Now the figure is 41 percent — and 53 percent for children born to women under 30, according to Child Trends, which analyzed 2009 data from the National Center for Health Statistics.\n",
      "Still, the issue received little attention until the publication last month of “Coming Apart,” a book by Charles Murray, a longtime critic of non-marital births.\n",
      "Large racial differences remain: 73 percent of black children are born outside marriage, compared with 53 percent of Latinos and 29 percent of whites. And educational differences are growing. About 92 percent of college-educated women are married when they give birth, compared with 62 percent of women with some post-secondary schooling and 43 percent of women with a high school diploma or less, according to Child Trends.\n",
      "Almost all of the rise in nonmarital births has occurred among couples living together. While in some countries such relationships endure at rates that resemble marriages, in the United States they are more than twice as likely to dissolve than marriages. In a summary of research, Pamela Smock and Fiona Rose Greenland, both of the University of Michigan, reported that two-thirds of couples living together split up by the time their child turned 10.\n",

      "FOR her internship in the fashion field last summer, Kate Kelly commuted to New York from Philadelphia.\n",
      "By fall, the internship had turned into a full-time job, and she was commuting five or six days a week. Ms. Kelly found herself rushing to catch the BoltBus to get home; her unpredictable hours made it tough to reserve ahead. When the bus was sold out, she took the New Jersey Transit train, switching in Trenton. It was often late at night by the time she got home to the studio loft in Society Hill that she shared with her boyfriend, Nick Sabean.\n",
      "The commute was “taking a pretty heavy toll,” said Mr. Sabean, who works in business development for technology startups and moonlights as a bartender. The two, who are both 30, seldom saw each other.\n",
      "The couple decided to hunt for an apartment in New York. They had been paying $800 a month in Philadelphia, but in New York, their budget for a one-bedroom in a central location, or at least with good subway access, topped out at $1,800.\n",
      "Ms. Kelly, who graduated from Temple University and received a graduate degree in fashion apparel studies from Philadelphia University, wasn’t sure where to begin. Friends warned her what not to do — not to use a broker, not to use Craigslist — but offered no good alternatives. Craigslist, however, “was my only vehicle to get an idea of what was out there,” she said. She pounded the pavement at lunch and after work.\n",
      "If a listing sounded reasonable, she was often shown “a completely different apartment at a different price,” she said. Places were tiny, run-down or far from the subway.\n",
      "On the occasions she saw someplace nice, “I wasn’t prepared for the spontaneous decision and all the paperwork that was required,” she said. “Nobody told me, ‘You are going to need six months of bank statements.’ ”\n",
      "Back in Philadelphia, Mr. Sabean, a graduate of Delaware Valley College in Doylestown, Pa., was picking up extra bartending shifts to save for the move. He sometimes sent Ms. Kelly information she didn’t have at hand. “I could go through our files, copy it, scan it and send it to her phone,” he said. “Technology played a huge role.”\n",
      "Between Ms. Kelly’s new job and outstanding school loans, the two weren’t ideal applicants. Ms. Kelly was even asked for proof she had never bounced a rent check.\n",
      "On several occasions, the couple rented a car and drove around neighborhoods of interest.\n",
      "“On Google or Google Earth, you can take a visual tour of places and see what the neighborhood looks like,” Mr. Sabean said. Still, “you see some outdated pictures. You can’t really get a feel until you’re there. It was good to be able to put two and two together and stand at those places.”\n",
      "They ventured to Hoboken, which both found “awesome and beautiful,” Ms. Kelly said. But the apartments they saw there were nearly half an hour from the PATH train to New York. “We walked and walked,” Ms. Kelly said. “What if it’s raining, it’s snowing, it’s dark?”\n",
      "Back in Manhattan, $1,795 a month bought a small, closet-free room with a bay window on West 103rd Street. “I was aghast,” Ms. Kelly said. “We thought a one-bedroom would be attainable, and we realized we were more in the studio section.”\n",
      "Prices were more affordable farther uptown. Ms. Kelly was hopeful about 3333 Broadway, the five-building complex on Broadway near 135th Street, “the biggest apartment building I have ever seen,” she said. (It has nearly 1,200 units.) A large renovated studio, with great Hudson River views, was $1,395. The listing mentioned an easy approval process.\n",
      "Still, their paperwork didn’t pass muster.\n",
      "Growing frantic, Ms. Kelly found the Hotel Alexander on West 94th Street, an extended-stay hotel. That was “something I had never heard of,” she said, “but it made sense to me.”\n",

      "Higgins informed Johnson of his decision toward the end of the regular season.\n",
      "In eight years with the team, Higgins, 37, assumed an integral role behind the scenes, helping the Jets build MetLife Stadium and move their headquarters to Florham Park, N.J.\n",
      "More recently, Higgins spearheaded the Jets’ incorporation of social media to increase their profile, using Facebook and Twitter to promote fan interaction. The Jets’ official Twitter feed has more than 296,000 followers, the most in the N.F.L.\n",

      "Fisher was introduced as the Rams’ coach after signing a five-year contract, reportedly worth $7 million a year. He chose the Rams over the Miami Dolphins.

      "A charge of widespread scientific fraud, involving 26 articles published in 11 journals, was leveled by the University of Connecticut today against Dipak K. Das, one of its researchers, whose work reported health benefits in red wine.\n",
      "Many of the articles reported positive effects from resveratrol, an ingredient of red wine thought to promote longevity in laboratory animals.\n",
      "The charges, if verified, seem unlikely to affect the field of resveratrol research itself, because Dr. Das’s work was peripheral to its central principles, several of which are in contention. “Today I had to look up who he is. His papers are mostly in specialty journals,” said David Sinclair, a leading resveratrol expert at the Harvard Medical School.\n",
      "The significance of the case seems more to reflect on the general system of apportioning research money. Researchers complain that federal grants are increasingly hard to get, even for high-quality research, yet money seemed to have flowed freely to Dr. Das, who was generating research of low visibility and apparently low quality. The University of Connecticut said Wednesday that it was returning two new grants to Dr. Das, worth a total of $890,000, to the federal government.\n",
      "The agency that granted the funds was the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Renate Myles, a spokeswoman, said in response that scientific misconduct “can go undetected for a length of time even under the most rigorous systems of research oversight and review.”\n",
      "The investigation of Dr. Das’s work began in January 2009, two weeks after the university received an anonymous allegation about research irregularities in his laboratory. A special review board headed by Dr. Kent Morest of the University of Connecticut has now produced a 60,000-page report, which has been forwarded to the Office of Research Integrity, a federal agency that investigates fraud by researchers who receive government grants.\n",
      "According to a 60-page summary of the report, Dr. Das’s published research articles were found to contain 145 instances of fabrication and falsification of data. Many involved cutting and pasting photographic images from a type of research record known as a western blot. Because western blots have often been subject to manipulations in the past, many journals require that the images not be altered in any way without an explicit description of the procedure.\n",
      "Dr. Das did not answer his phone at the university or respond to e-mail.\n",
      "The university has sent a copy of its report to the editors of the 11 journals that published the suspect articles.\n",
      "Adam Marcus, who edits the blog Retraction Watch, an inventory of the growing number of discredited scientific reports, said he would be monitoring the journals to see whether retractions were issued, a step that some editors are reluctant to take.\n",
      "Dr. Das was a prolific publisher of research. His name appears on 588 articles listed in Google Scholar, though some may be by other researchers with the same name and initials. Most of the articles concern the effect of drugs on the heart, including 117 articles on resveratrol.\n",

      "SINCE its introduction in the United States in 2002, Axe, the body spray and grooming brand by Unilever , has been pitched squarely at young men, with commercials depicting women getting a whiff of Axe users and then aggressively pursuing them.\n",
      "But now, Axe is introducing a fragrance for women.\n",
      "The new scent, Anarchy, is being marketed in different versions for men and women. As its name portends, a new commercial depicts a scene of mayhem, with a chain of events including a car pileup. During the spot, strangers lock eyes and, oblivious to the commotion, walk hungrily toward one another, then freeze at about an arm’s length, nostrils flaring and chests heaving, not breaking the sexual tension with contact.\n",
      "“Unleash the chaos,” says screen text at the close of the commercial, as a young man and woman spray their torsos. “New Axe Anarchy for him and for her.”\n",
      "The campaign, which includes print and online ads, is by the London office of Bartle Bogle Hegarty. The first of two commercials will appear on Axe’s Facebook page Tuesday, and both are scheduled to begin running widely on television in the United States Jan. 29, and afterward in more than 60 other countries. (A teaser commercial that did not specifically mention the women’s product began running online and in movie theaters on Jan. 1.)\n",
      "On Tuesday, Axe also will introduce a branded serialized graphic novel on YouTube and Facebook in a partnership with the publisher Aspen Comics. New sequences will be uploaded every few days, with plot turns based partly on consumers’ suggestions and votes, and with some fans being depicted in the comic.\n",
      "Axe, which declined to disclose the cost of the campaign, spent $92.5 million on domestic advertising in 2010, and $42.8 million in the first nine months of 2011, according to Kantar Media, which is owned by WPP.\n",
      "In another new commercial, a female police officer chases a male robber on foot, both tossing off layers of clothing in the heat of the chase. It ends with them facing each other, the robber having shed his stolen goods and the officer her gun, then walking toward each other to embrace in the middle of the screen. The new commercials are about “subverting expectations of what an Axe commercial is,” said David Kolbusz, a creative director at Bartle Bogle Hegarty in London. “Before, an Axe commercial was always about a guy spraying himself and a girl being attracted, and Axe giving him an edge in the mating game, whereas now women also have something to spray on themselves, and consequently there’s more of an equilibrium between the sexes.”\n",
      "Of Axe’s 2.3 million “likes” on Facebook, about a quarter are by women, according to Barret Roberts, the senior brand manager at Axe.\n",
      "“We’ve been hearing for some time that females have been asking for and looking for their very own scent of Axe,” said Mr. Roberts.\n",
      "Axe dominates the men’s body spray category, with a 74 percent share of the market, according to SymphonyIRI Group, a market research firm.\n",
      "While only about 17 percent of American men use body spray — 65 percent use aftershave and 62 percent use cologne — it is most popular among those ages 18 to 24, with 28 percent using it, according to Mintel, the market research firm. (While Axe reports that it pitches Axe primarily to men 18 to 24, the brand also is popular among adolescent boys, but Mintel does not track usage for those under 18.)\n",
      "As for women, 47 percent use body spray, second to body lotion with fragrance, which is used by 59 percent, but more popular than eau de parfum (43 percent) or eau de toilette (34 percent).\n",
      "For Axe Anarchy, the women’s body spray is being released in what Unilever calls a limited edition, with it possibly being offered permanently based on sales. On the men’s side only, in addition to the body spray, Anarchy also will be available as a deodorant, antiperspirant, shower gel and shampoo.\n",
      "While over the last decade the women in Axe ads who throw themselves at men have consistently been stunning, the men have tended to be more average-looking, the message to male consumers being that the fragrances would attract women who would otherwise be out of their league.\n",
      "In the new commercials, the actresses are no less attractive, but are not sold so short: some male actors have the chiseled features of GQ models.\n",
      "“Girls in Axe advertising will always be a little better-looking than the guys, but the question is to what degree,” said Mr. Kolbusz, of Bartle Bogle Hegarty, adding that the more conventionally handsome actors in the Anarchy ads will still appeal to typical Axe users.\n",
      "“The guys can look a little more aspirational in the lead roles without the average guy feeling threatened,” Mr. Kolbusz said.\n",
      "Axe “is the first brand that I can think of that made the teenaged boy a hero in a way that was interesting,” said David Vinjamuri, author of “Accidental Branding” and an adjunct professor of marketing at New York University.\n",
      "“If you’re a teenaged boy and you looked at the advertising, you saw the girl that you want and the guy that you are,” Mr. Vinjamuri said. “What was brilliant about Axe is they said make the girl hunt you based on your smell.”\n",
      "What did not pass the sniff test with him, however, was the new plan to pitch the brand to women.\n",
      "“When you start talking to someone who’s not your core audience, you lose credibility with your core audience,” Mr. Vinjamuri said. “The moment you start talking to girls, you lose credibility with teenage boys.”\n",

      "Last month, I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq. Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought — and several thousand gave their lives.\n",
      "We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world. (Applause.) For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. (Applause.) For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country. (Applause.) Most of al Qaeda’s top lieutenants have been defeated. The Taliban’s momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home.\n",
      "These achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness and teamwork of America’s Armed Forces. At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations. They’re not consumed with personal ambition. They don’t obsess over their differences. They focus on the mission at hand. They work together.\n",
      "Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example. (Applause.) Think about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world in educating its people. An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs. A future where we’re in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren’t so tied to unstable parts of the world. An economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded.\n",
      "We can do this. I know we can, because we’ve done it before. At the end of World War II, when another generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known. (Applause.) My grandfather, a veteran of Patton’s Army, got the chance to go to college on the GI Bill. My grandmother, who worked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth.\n",
      "The two of them shared the optimism of a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism. They understood they were part of something larger; that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share — the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement.\n",
      "The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. No challenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. (Applause.) What’s at stake aren’t Democratic values or Republican values, but American values. And we have to reclaim them.\n",
      "Let’s remember how we got here. Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores. Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete. Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren’t, and personal debt that kept piling up.\n",
      "In 2008, the house of cards collapsed. We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn’t afford or understand them. Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people’s money. Regulators had looked the other way, or didn’t have the authority to stop the bad behavior.\n",

      "NOT long ago Alanna Heiss, the renowned curator and self-described art radical, brandished two guns at the Clocktower Gallery, the nonprofit art space she runs in Lower Manhattan. “They’re props,” she said with a grin, adding, “but they’re also for critics.”\n",
      "Never mind how she got them past the heavy security in the lobby of this city-owned building on Leonard Street, which has housed her wild installations since 1972 and, more recently, Art International Radio. She had other things in mind, most urgently to give a tour of her space. Ready?\n",
      "“This is by Margot Farrington and Tony Martin, who did lights for the Grateful Dead’s concerts,” she said as she darted in and out of a room of shifting colors. Lights flashed overhead with strange sounds. “That’s by Tony Oursler,” she said. “Isn’t it wonderful?”\n",
      "Probably, but there wasn’t a moment to think about it because Ms. Heiss, like the rabbit in Alice’s Wonderland, had already gone down the hall and into a retro-looking lounge with an old turntable and radio, installed by Sabina Streeter. A waltz was playing. “This piece is about the Nazi use of radio propaganda,” she said.\n",
      "In the Art International Radio studio next door, which broadcasts innovative programs on the Internet, she reflected on radio’s ability to occupy mental, rather than physical, space, something she once had plenty of from 1976 to 2008 as the director of P.S. 1, the massive contemporary art institution she founded in Long Island City in an abandoned school building.\n",
      "“But that’s past, and I’m always thinking about the next thing,” she said. She pointed to an old phone booth installation by the art team Japanther. “Pick it up and listen,” she commanded. Who would dare say no?\n",
      "At the main exhibit, called “Candy Canyon,” a cinemascopic installation by Mike Anderson and the sonic duo Javelin, she scurried through a realistic-looking cabin and cavern, and past cactuses while a soundtrack of trippy cowboy music filled the darkness. At the end, she stepped into a Western-saloon-style room and sat down on a bale of hay while a mock cowboy music video played on a big screen. She was beaming.\n",
      "“When people see this show, they tell me, ‘Alanna, you’re really back,’ ” she said.\n",
      "Actually, she never went away. But after the Museum of Modern Art, which oversees P.S. 1, asked her to retire, some assumed she would vanish. She was, after all, in her mid-60s and to be replaced by Klaus Biesenbach, a young curator she had trained.\n",
      "“I have the fortune to know someone I trust is carrying on what I started,” she said. “And I get to continue working here with younger artists, which is what I love.”\n",
      "Indeed, Ms. Heiss, who organized a show called “Arctic Hysteria” now traveling around the world, and has received numerous awards, including the French Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres, is not only without regret but also without brakes. Instead of being bitter and nostalgic, she is on fire, it seems, spitting in the face of anything having to do with retirement, and hopping up the stairs of her gallery with the agility of a mountain goat. She has no interest in looking back, despite the giant clock that looms over her domain.\n",
      "“The passing of time isn’t about memories for me,” she said, as she stood in an upper gallery of the tower designed by Stanford White. “It’s about layers of good art.”\n",
      "In her decades of running the Clocktower Gallery, many of which overlapped with running P.S. 1, Dennis Oppenheim performed and Nam June Paik presented his chocolate-covered woman playing video cello. And outside, under the illuminated clock face surrounded by federal justice buildings and peering employees in offices, Gordon Matta-Clark once got naked, lathered up and hosed himself down.\n",
      "“To me, one of the most important things in life is to have fun,” she said.\n",
      "Up on the roof of the building, under a white fur hat and wrapped in a white fur coat, the Kentucky-born Ms. Heiss, who learned about encouraging artists from her days as a piano accompanist in high school, looked east over the city that drew her years ago. She could see Long Island City, an art mecca many would say she was responsible for creating. She could also see the Brooklyn Bridge, where, as an example of the kind of projects she would be doing as the founder of P.S. 1 and the Institute for Art and Urban Resources, she curated an avant-garde celebration in 1971 that featured work by Philip Glass, Sol LeWitt and Carl Andre.\n",
      "“New York was a different place then,” said Ms. Heiss, who still finds it hard to accept the commercialism that has taken hold of younger artists. “It was a time when artists were open to all kinds of collaboration. That’s what I want to create again.”\n",
      "By all accounts, she is succeeding. Although some critics had issues with the chaotic installation by James Franco she presented last year (none had to face the guns in her office), people are flocking to the concerts and events that she and her staff are presenting.\n",
      "“No regrets,” she said, while looking at the giant clock tower above. “None.”\n",
      "Just then, a man appeared on the roof from under the clock: Michael Stipe, one of her many well-known supporters. Last year, he showed innovative videos in her space.\n",

      "“Not yet, I wanted to see you first,” he said.\n",

      "PARK CITY, Utah — “The buzz means nothing,” said Robert Redford as his Sundance Film Festival opened in this luxury ski town last week. “Wait until it’s over, and see what sticks.”\n",
      "That’s pretty much the case for any film festival, but it is especially true about Sundance, where every movie, aggressively angling for a distribution deal, arrives with a publicist (or five) in tow. Hotly anticipated pictures fall head first into snowdrifts, and obscure ones surprise and become overnight sensations once audiences (and critics) are let into the theaters.\n",
      "Still, the disconnect this year between expectations going into Sundance and the results coming out has been particularly pronounced.\n",
      "The two most high-profile films before the festival — “Lay the Favorite,” directed by Stephen Frears, and Spike Lee’s “Red Hook Summer” — both landed with a critical thud and are still looking for buyers. The buzz bubble also quickly popped on the romantic comedy “Celeste and Jesse Forever,” starring Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg, with IndieWire.com listing it as an “overwhelming underwhelm.”\n",
      "“The Queen of Versailles,” a documentary about a billionaire and his wife that spawned a defamation lawsuit even before it had its premiere, got a looks-like-reality-TV shrug from critics, one of whom called it “a strange hybrid between ‘Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous’ and ‘Hoarders.’ ” “Bachelorette,” a mean-girl marriage comedy starring Kirsten Dunst, arrived on a wave of “Bridesmaids” comparisons, but some moviegoers found it too, well, mean.\n",
      "Meanwhile, a movie that caused several buyers to roll their eyes before the festival began — “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” a drama tinged with magical realism, about a 6-year-old named Hushpuppy in bayou country — became an instant must-see after an early audience gave it a standing ovation, and critics drooled.\n",
      "Other movies that entered with little heat (“Robot and Frank,” with Frank Langella, about a retired jewel thief and his mechanized caretaker) or arrived with negative buzz (“The Surrogate,” with a very naked Helen Hunt as a sex worker), emerged with rosy futures, or at least distribution deals.\n",
      "Sundance 2012, which culminates on Saturday with its awards presentation, has also sharply defied predictions on the business side, the marketplace where indie distributors like the Weinstein Company shop for films as if they were browsing a cinematic Walmart.\n",
      "Ahead of the festival, sales agents predicted a flurry of big-money purchases by distributors. That strutting was not just hype: More than 40 movies sold last year, one of the biggest buying binges in Sundance history, and the health of the indie marketplace has since improved, partly because of newly robust video-on-demand revenue. For instance, “Margin Call,” starring Kevin Spacey, generated about $4 million from on-demand services in 2011, close to its entire North American box office total.\n",
      "But it quickly became clear that the mood of buyers was not in alignment with that of sellers. “There were a lot of good films, but not a lot of great ones,” said Michael Barker, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics.\n",
      "The pace of acquisitions was steady if not exactly brisk. Magnolia Pictures paid an undisclosed price for the North American theatrical rights to “The Queen of Versailles” less than 24 hours after its premiere. But more typical was “Lay the Favorite,” about a stripper turned sports bettor that stars Rebecca Hall, Bruce Willis and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Made at a cost of about $15 million, this comedic drama has yet to land in a shopping cart; its best hope now may be a bidder willing to spend a couple of million dollars, banking on strong on-demand revenue.\n",
      "In what appears to be the biggest deal of this year’s festival, Fox Searchlight paid an estimated $6 million for “The Surrogate,” starring Ms. Hunt as a woman who helps a poet with an iron lung (John Hawkes) lose his virginity. More often, filmmakers made do with $2 million to $2.5 million, the estimated prices paid for films like “Robot and Frank”; “For a Good Time, Call...,” a female-driven comedy about phone sex; “The Words,” a thriller starring Bradley Cooper; and “Arbitrage,” a financial thriller starring Richard Gere.\n",
      "Last year, by the time the festival closed, the Weinstein Company had paid about $7.5 million (and an additional $10 million advertising guarantee) for “The Details,” a dark comedy starring Tobey Maguire, and about $7 million (and a $15 million advertising guarantee) for “My Idiot Brother,” a comedy starring Paul Rudd. Sundance’s sales record was set in 2006, when Fox Searchlight paid $10.5 million for “Little Miss Sunshine,” which took in over $100 million at the global box office.\n",
      "What happened? Despite the hoopla surrounding Sundance — publicists sent this reporter 419 unsolicited pitches for articles tied to the festival — seasoned buyers practiced what Mr. Redford preached and were cautious about overbidding.\n",
      "Part of the restraint came from a recognition that last year’s shopping spree did not deliver results. “Margin Call” was an exception, but almost every other movie from the festival fizzled, including “Martha Marcy May Marlene,” “Another Earth” and “The Art of Getting By,” all purchased last year by Fox Searchlight. “Like Crazy” bombed at the box office for Paramount; “My Idiot Brother” (whose title was changed to “Our Idiot Brother” for its release) failed to meet expectations. “The Details” hasn’t been released yet, although Weinstein is looking at an early summer or midfall date.\n",
      "And not a single Sundance movie from last year has been a major awards contender.\n",
      "There is a silver lining here: A slow, low-priced festival may be a good thing for independent film. One reason that the art house sector has gone through such a difficult retrenchment in recent years involves ever-escalating prices; as buyers started to spend more for quirky pictures, they also had to spend more on marketing to assure a bigger audience, and the economics of the business started to implode.

      "Newt Gingrich and his wife, Callista, reported income of $3.16 million in 2010, according to tax returns posted on his Web site on Thursday night, and paid an effective tax rate double what Mitt Romney, one of his rivals for the Republican nomination, has said he pays.\n",
      "The couple’s income included $450,245 in salary from companies they control and about $2.53 million in income from partnerships and corporations, including Gingrich Productions. Mr. Gingrich also earned $41,625 in speaking fees and payments for serving on the boards of directors of various companies, as well as a $76,200 pension from the federal government.\n",
      "The couple, who live in Virginia, paid $994,708 in federal taxes, leaving them with an effective federal tax rate of 31.7 percent.\n",
      "Mr. Gingrich and other Republican candidates have repeatedly called on Mr. Romney, whose family wealth is estimated to be as high as $250 million, to release his taxes. While Mr. Romney has so far refused, he acknowledged this week paying an effective tax rate on his income of about 15 percent. That is about half of the rate Mr. Gingrich’s returns reflect, though Mr. Romney and his wife had at least three times as much income during 2010 and part of 2011 as Mr. Gingrich and wife reported on their 2010 returns, according to personal financial disclosures Mr. Romney released in August.\n",
      "Mr. Romney, who has said he will release a return in April, also reported earning speaking fees of about $374,000.\n",
      "The two men pay different effective tax rates because of how they made their money. The vast majority of Mr. and Mrs. Romney’s income comes from investments of millions of dollars, much of which would typically be taxed at the 15 percent rate for capital gains and dividends.\n",
      "Most of Mr. Gingrich’s income comes from salary and partnerships. The couple also reported $4,184 in short-term capital gains, $32,541 in net long-term capital losses, and about $18,000 in dividend income, along with $6,853 in rental income from real estate holdings.\n",
      "The tax return — which appeared to be the first Mr. Gingrich has released in his long political career—also shows how much wealthier the former speaker has become since he resigned from the House of Representatives in 1998 and began building political advocacy and consulting businesses. In the federal financial disclosure forms Mr. Gingrich filed for 1997, he reported income between $376,324 and $450,909.\n",
      "Mr. Gingrich, who angrily denied allegations on Thursday from his second wife, Marianne Gingrich, that he asked her for an “open marriage,” also reported paying $19,800 in alimony in 2010.\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Gingrich reported paying income, Social Security and Medicare taxes on the wages paid to the couple’s household employees. Their charitable contributions totaled $81,333 — about 2.6 percent of their adjusted gross income.\n",
      "The affiliated companies listed on Mr. Gingrich’s return include Gingrich Productions, the company that produced the couple’s documentary films and where Mrs. Gingrich serves as president, and Gingrich Holdings.\n",
      "Gingrich Holdings also contributed $152,609 to the Gingrich Foundation, a tax-exempt charitable organization, for which Mr. Gingrich’s campaign also released tax returns on Thursday night.

      "MANCHESTER, N.H. — Campaign advisers to former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, stung by unexpectedly fierce attacks from Republican rivals on his career as a corporate buyout specialist, are scrambling to avoid a prolonged and nasty battle over his business record before it does lasting damage to the front-runner.\n",
      "Although the advisers had always expected that Democrats would malign Mr. Romney’s work of buying and selling companies, they were largely unprepared for an assault that came so early in the campaign and from within the ranks of their own party, those involved in the campaign discussions said.\n",
      "Even as Mr. Romney coasted to victory in New Hampshire, they worry that the critique could prove more potent as the race shifts to South Carolina, where shuttered mills dot the landscape, unemployment is higher and suspicion of financial elites is not limited to left-leaning voters.\n",
      "Some advisers to Romney argue that the most forceful way to rebut the mounting criticism is to prominently tell the stories of winners as well as the losers in the world of private equity: municipal pension funds that invested in his firm, Bain Capital, and rank-and-file workers hired by the companies that Mr. Romney helped turn around.\n",
      "The campaign intends to cast Mr. Romney, a founder and a former chief executive of Bain Capital, as a defender of market capitalism, a bedrock principle of Republicanism, and to suggest that those who assail his business background are outside the party’s mainstream.\n",
      "In his victory speech Tuesday night, Mr. Romney lamented that “desperate Republicans” were attacking the free enterprise system and the very notion of success.\n",
      "“This is such a mistake for our party and for our nation,” he said. “The country already has a leader who divides us with the bitter politics of envy.”\n",
      "That message was echoed by Mr. Romney’s surrogates and embraced by a number of influential conservatives on Tuesday, from Rush Limbaugh to Michelle Malkin and the Club for Growth.\n",
      "“It’s oddly uniting conservatives around him,” said Jim Dyke, a Republican strategist based in Charleston.\n",
      "Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina joined the growing chorus of Republicans who expressed discomfort with the Republican attacks on the buyout practices exercised by Bain when Mr. Romney was there.\n",
      "Speaking on the Mark Levin radio show immediately after Mr. Romney gave his acceptance speech, Mr. DeMint, who endorsed Mr. Romney in 2008 but has not endorsed anybody this year, said, “He’s hitting a lot of the hot buttons for me about balancing the budget, and frankly, I’m a little concerned about the few Republicans who have criticized some of what I consider the free-market principles here.”\n",
      "The attacks on Mr. Romney are especially unsettling to his campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, who worries that a narrative depicting Romney as a heartless corporate raider will drag down his favorability rating and be sustained by the Obama campaign, said two people told of the internal discussions. (Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior strategist for Mr. Romney, played down such concerns. “I wouldn’t read too much into the rumors,” he said.)\n",
      "While his campaign advisers generally agree that Mr. Romney must explain his work at Bain, they are wary of engaging in an exhaustive public examination of the nearly 100 deals he was involved in, anxious that it could bog him down in the inevitably messy details of fixing troubled companies, whether they are job cuts or big financial payouts.\n",
      "His rivals, however, are eager to delve deeply into the particulars of what they view as Mr. Romney’s biggest political vulnerability.\n",
      "Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is zeroing in on two companies that, under Bain’s supervision, together laid off hundreds of workers in South Carolina. On Tuesday, in Fort Mill, S.C., Mr. Perry compared buyout firms like Bain to predatory animals.\n",
      "“They’re just vultures,” Mr. Perry said. “They’re vultures that are sitting out there on the tree limb waiting for the company to get sick, and then they swoop in, they eat the carcass, they leave with that and they leave the skeleton.”\n",

      "“Elizabeth the Queen: The Life of a Modern Monarch.” By Sally Bedell Smith. 688 pages. Random House. $30.\n",
      "AT Christmas in 1943, when Queen Elizabeth was a 17-year-old princess, she was so enraptured by a tall, blond, blue-eyed prince named Philip that she flushed whenever his name was mentioned. Prince Philip (her distant cousin) was a 22-year-old naval lieutenant who’d spent the previous summer on a British destroyer being dive-bombed by German Stukas. When the princess put his photograph on her mantel, her nanny chided her to take it down.\n",
      "But Philip himself kept a photograph of Elizabeth in his naval cabin, and after war’s end, his MG began regularly “roaring into the forecourt of Buckingham Palace” to court the heiress presumptive. When the couple married, on Nov. 20, 1947, early in Britain’s long, bleak postwar era, Winston Churchill hailed their union as “a flash of colour on the hard road we have to travel.”\n",
      "The road ahead was to prove hard for the young couple as well. Five years later, their marriage was put to the test when Elizabeth’s father, King George VI, died at the age of 56. At the time, the couple were in Kenya, perched in a treetop hotel, filming elephants, unaware of the drama unfolding in London.\n",
      "At dawn, a white eagle swooped above them; soon after, they descended to life-changing news. Elizabeth had “climbed up that ladder as a princess,” her cousin Lady Pamela Mountbatten recalled, but “she was going to have to climb down again as queen.”\n",
      "At once, her war-hero husband had to adjust to a supporting role. As Prince Philip’s equerry and Navy friend Mike Parker later recalled: “He saw immediately that the idyll of his life and their life together had come to an end. I never felt so sorry for anyone in my life.”\n",
      "This portrait of the early days of their marriage comes from a remarkable new biography of the prince by the British writer Philip Eade. The book does for the royal consort what Helen Mirren did for his wife in the 2006 movie “The Queen,” breathing life into a figure who had seemed stiff and remote. Did you know that Prince Philip was smuggled out of Greece as a baby in a fruit crate in 1922, as his father, Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, evaded execution? Did you know that his mother was institutionalized when he was 8, at which point his father drifted off to Monte Carlo and Paris, leaving the boy effectively homeless (though he spent boarding-school holidays with his mother’s relatives)? Did you know that his mother became a nun, and was honored by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations — the highest honor Israel grants non-Jews — for her wartime actions?\n",
      "This book, along with an excellent, all-embracing new biography of Queen Elizabeth II by the superb chronicler Sally Bedell Smith, comes out in time to help American readers appreciate the facets of this complex pair in the year of the queen’s Diamond Jubilee, the 60th anniversary of her accession to the British throne.\n",
      "Why should America care about this very British occasion? You might ask President Obama and the British prime minister, David Cameron, who call Britain’s connection with the United States not the “special” relationship but the “essential” relationship.” Or the millions of viewers who tuned in on television or on the Internet last April to glimpse the wedding of Elizabeth and Philip’s grandson Prince William to Kate Middleton; or the Californians who cheered the newlyweds on their American tour last summer. At a time of global economic malaise, The Times of London wrote, “there was sunshine and laughter and happiness that everyone could join in.”\n",
      "This jubilee year serves a similar function (the festivities take place in London on the first weekend of June, with a pageant of a thousand boats on the Thames), but so far the celebratory mood has received a couple of jolts. Prince Philip — now 90 — spent Christmas in the hospital, having a stent put in his heart, while the queen and the rest of the family were gathered at the vast country estate Sandringham, a royal holiday tradition since the 19th century, when King Edward VII (then the Prince of Wales) built an enormous Jacobean-style pile there. And on New Year’s Day 2012, another ill omen emerged: a body was found on the grounds of Sandringham.\n",
      "How did the queen react? Unsurprisingly, a woman who did not flinch when a gunman fired six shots at her while she was Trooping the Color on horseback in 1981 (they were blanks), and who has weathered the scandals and calamities generated by her children — Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and their spouses — did not lose her cool. “I find that I can often put things out of mind which are disagreeable,” she once said. It is a capacity that has served her well.\n",
      "Ms. Bedell Smith pulls fascinating details into her portrait of Elizabeth, shining a beam onto underlighted corners of the monarch’s experience. She shows the sovereign fixing trucks and “crawling on her stomach” stalking red deer in the Scottish Highlands; visiting a Maryland supermarket on a United States tour; cheering and fist-pumping when one of her horses wins a race; and boogieing with Nelson Mandela. Yet she also shows her as a world-class diplomat, who used her influence to keep the British Commonwealth united over six decades; and moderated the actions of the British Parliament through her weekly audiences with a dozen successive British prime ministers. In the last decade of her 60 years on the throne (only Queen Victoria reigned longer), Queen Elizabeth II, now 85, has nimbly transformed the British monarchy from an inaccessible, mysterious institution to a people-friendly organization with a Web site, Twitter and Facebook pages.\n",
      "On the day in 1952 when a 25-year-old mother of two became queen — “this heavy task that has been lain upon me so early in my life,” she called it at the time — her long-term success at fulfilling this role could not be guaranteed. But her accession led one rising British politician to write that the young queen might “help to remove the last shreds of prejudice against women aspiring to the highest places,” so that “a new era for women will indeed be at hand.”\n",
      "That politician was Margaret Thatcher, and 27 years after she wrote those words, she arrived at Buckingham Palace for her first audience with the queen as prime minister. They didn’t indulge in “any hint of ‘girl talk,’ ” Ms. Bedell Smith writes. Both exceptional women had to reckon with the “push and pull of combining professional life and motherhood, and the challenges of having a husband in a subordinate position.” But they, and their spouses, also knew that their primary duty was not personal, but political: to heed the British imperative to “keep calm and carry on” ... so everyone else could, too.\n",

      "JERUSALEM — Israelis like to say that when it comes to military and security operations, those who know don’t talk, and those who talk don’t know. But the intense and increasingly public debate about whether to attack Iran ’s nuclear facilities is challenging that piece of conventional wisdom.\n",
      "The standard view has been that successful attacks rely on secrecy and surprise, so the more talk there is about an operation, the less likely it will occur.\n",
      "One year ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seemed to support that theory. He told foreign journalists that Iran briefly stopped working on a nuclear weapon only once, in 2003, because that was when the United States attacked Iraq, and Iran feared it might be next.\n",
      "“The paradox,” Mr. Netanyahu said then, “is that if there is a credible military option, you won’t have to use it.”\n",
      "In other words, the more noise you make about war, the less likely you will have to resort to it.\n",
      "But few who have spent time with Israel’s decision makers in recent months have come away believing that the talk of a military assault is merely a well-scripted act of public diplomacy. It is that, to be sure, but there is more. It is also a window into the government’s thinking.\n",
      "Israel believes that its threats to attack Iran have been the catalyst that has pushed much of the world to agree to harsh sanctions on Iran’s energy and banking sectors, sanctions that otherwise would not have been agreed to. It believes further that the Iranian economy is fragile and the popularity of the Tehran government is low, so that there is a small chance the sanctions could force a change of policy or a political crisis in Iran.\n",
      "But Israel’s top leaders also worry that the sanctions are too late and that, in the end, a military assault is the only way to accomplish their goal — stopping Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. So the talk in this crisis is not made instead of action, but in addition to it — and perhaps as a prelude to it.\n",
      "This was clear again last Thursday evening when the defense minister, Ehud Barak, spoke publicly about what he viewed as the existential nature of the Iranian issue. He said the decisions he and his colleagues faced today were “no less fateful” than those facing the Zionist leaders who founded Israel in 1948 or those just before and during the wars of 1967 and 1973.\n",
      "“The leader has to decide when to act and when to wait, when and what to declare and when to keep silent,” Mr. Barak told the annual Herzliya Conference devoted to Israel’s security.\n",
      "He said that never in Israel’s history had a topic of such import been debated with such thoroughness and frankness as this one. An Iran with nuclear weapons, he asserted, would be “far more complex, dangerous and costly in blood and money than stopping it today would be.”\n",
      "“Those who say ‘later,’ may find that later is too late,” he warned, and added, “We mean what we say.”\n",
      "Iran says its nuclear program is for civilian purposes only, but the United States, European states and Israel believe that Iran’s goal is to build weapons. Israel is more worried than the others, however, because Iran has singled it out, calling it a “tumor” that should be removed, and the government in Tehran finances and arms violent anti-Israel groups.\n",
      "Opinions in Israel, however, are far from unanimous on the idea of an assault. The military establishment is unenthusiastic, and that includes several of the most important generals, active and retired. Many reject the conclusion that Mr. Barak and Mr. Netanyahu have embraced, that an Israeli attack would produce only a limited and bearable conflict.\n",
      "Alex Fishman, a military analyst for the newspaper Yediot Aharonot, wrote on Sunday that a former commander of the air force, Gen. Eitan Ben-Eliahu, likened the situation to the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 when President John F. Kennedy threatened to bomb Cuba if Soviet nuclear missiles were not removed from there.\n",
      "The Cuban crisis stood on three legs, he said: a naval blockade imposed on Cuba by the United States, military threats and a diplomatic channel of dialogue that allowed the Soviets ultimately to back down. The Iranian crisis, General Ben-Eliahu was quoted as saying, has two of those legs — sanctions and military threats — but it is far from clear that it has the needed diplomatic channel.\n",
      "The discussion here of an Israeli attack has grown so loud lately that some now worry that it has become counterproductive as a diplomatic tool. Amos Yadlin, a retired general who used to direct military intelligence in Israel, said on the radio on Sunday that it was time to quiet that talk.\n",
      "“These statements have reached the point where they have crossed the line from bringing benefit and are beginning to cause damage,” he said. “I’ll give you an example. I saw on an Iranian Web site this morning thoughts like, ‘If this is the situation, maybe we should attack first.’ I think there is a danger of escalation that will get out of control. Right now we should do what Israel knows how to do well — keep quiet.”\n",

      "IF the meatball parmigiana hero were a Southern dish, scholars from Chapel Hill, N.C., to Tallahassee, Fla., would hold academic conferences every six months just to talk about it.\n",
      "If it were a Florentine dish, the Four Seasons would have it on the menu for $95, or $55 without white truffles.\n",
      "But it is an Italian-American dish. It is at home on Wooster Street in New Haven, Atwells Avenue in Providence and Salem Street in Boston. It cannot be ordered at any restaurant that uses a truffle shaver. The closest thing to an academic symposium in its honor would be the lectures on the Food Network given by Prof. Giada De Laurentiis.\n",
      "Italian-American cuisine is not beloved by the arbiters of good taste, who celebrate risotto alla Milanese but ignore baked ziti, garlic bread, spaghetti and meatballs and lobster fra diavolo.\n",
      "“We’ve certainly moved, as a nation, beyond those dishes,” the food columnist Josh Ozersky declared on Time.com last year.\n",
      "In that case, I would like somebody to explain why my mind keeps drifting back to the meatball parmigiana hero at Parm. Like most things at Parm, which opened on Mulberry Street in November, it is prepared by cooks wearing white paper hats and is set before you in a red plastic basket. And, like most things at Parm, it is completely faithful to your memories while being much, much better than you remembered.\n",
      "At first, the sandwich exhibits nothing out of the ordinary. The tomato sauce, simple and summery, just seems to have been made by a good cook. The mozzarella and torn leaves of basil are fresh, which isn’t unheard of. The seeded roll is completely normal. The meatballs are not normal. For starters, they are not balls, they are patties. Anyone who has ever taken a bite of a meatball hero and watched one of the meatballs launch into orbit will recognize at once the significance of this deviation. Patties stay put.\n",
      "Most sub-shop meatballs are as hard as a 15-minute egg. The patties at Parm are not. Your teeth fall right through them.\n",
      "And when they do, you find something else that isn’t normal: the meat is juicy and rosy pink on the inside, the color of a perfectly cooked pork chop. The meatballs, made from veal, beef and sweet Italian sausage, are pink because they were braised at 180 degrees in a CVap low-temperature cooker for 40 minutes. They were braised at 180 degrees because Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone, the chefs behind Parm, studied fancy-restaurant techniques under chefs like Andrew Carmellini, Mario Batali and Wylie Dufresne.\n",
      "But the meatballs are sitting on a hero roll because Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Carbone are Italian-Americans who, once they had a restaurant of their own, decided to cook what is a kind of soul food for them and for millions of other Americans, even those with no Italian ancestors.\n",
      "This hybrid cuisine was created by immigrants who were, overwhelmingly, born in Southern Italy, at a time when the region was rural, overpopulated and desperately poor. More recently, when chefs and food writers studied authentic Italian food, they tended to travel to the wealthier north.\n",
      "Italian-American cooking, a bastardized cuisine with roots in an out-of-fashion region, was doubly uncool. Mr. Carbone, in a phone interview, said that when he was working at Babbo, “The sense I got was that the food of Italy was legitimate food, and the food Rich and I grew up eating was this weird thing we shouldn’t talk about.”\n",
      "Parm is essentially an expanded rendition of the lunch operation that the two chefs used to run at their first restaurant, Torrisi Italian Specialties, next door. (That restaurant now focuses all its energy on its prix fixe tasting menus.)\n",
      "Parm makes former Torrisi lunch standards like heroes and a marvelous array of vegetable side dishes. But the menu has grown to include, for instance, baked clams. Briny and just-cooked beneath crumbs of sesame breadsticks, they are like the meatballs in that all their divergences from the original are improvements.\n",
      "That’s the case with the fried calamari, too. Very small, very sweet and absolutely tender, they share their basket with two kinds of fried hot peppers that keep the squid from overstaying its welcome, as it sometimes can.\n",
      "With other recipes, Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Carbone do not tweak the original. They throw it under the bus. You may know pizza knots as the cold, lumpish chew toys that let pizzerias unload their stale dough. The warm pizza knots at Parm levitate, held down in their basket, it seems, only by a veil of grated cheese.\n",
      "The turkey sandwich at the old Torrisi persuaded many people, for the first time in their lives, to eat turkey more than once a year. It reappears at Parm (there would have been a riot had it not) served, as before, on a round semolina roll or on a hero. For the first time, it’s also on the menu as a platter, with a choice of baked ziti or salad on the side.\n",

      "When I have any kind of slaw on hand I usually make a lunch of it, with cottage cheese mounded on top; all the better if I have some cooked quinoa to add to the mix. I noticed recently that shredded broccoli stems were a main ingredient in a packaged coleslaw at my local supermarket – a great idea for using up the stems cut away from broccoli sold by the crown or floret. It’s much more economical to buy broccoli on the stem, which gives you the fixings for this salad. It takes minutes to peel and then shred them in a food processor. Don’t use the food processor for shredding cabbage, though — that’s better done by hand if you don’t want mush.\n",

      "The number of Americans applying for first-time jobless benefits rose last week, the Labor Department reported on Thursday, reversing a recent decline and suggesting the labor market remained brittle.\n",
      "Separately, the Commerce Department said retail sales rose at the weakest pace in seven months in December, as consumers pulled back toward the end of the holiday shopping season, cutting purchases at department stores and spending less on electronics.\n",
      "The retail sales data suggests “that spending isn’t really picking up any momentum,” said Sean Incremona, an economist at 4Cast in New York.\n",
      "Robust factory output and improved hiring have fed the view that the economy has so far resisted a global slowdown as the euro zone grapples with a likely recession.\n",
      "Initial claims for unemployment benefits rose to 399,000 in the first week of 2012, the highest in six weeks, from an upwardly revised 375,000 a week earlier. The four-week average of claims was also higher, rising to 381,750 from 374,000.\n",
      "The Labor Department report also showed 3.63 million continuing claims, up from 3.61 million.\n",
      "Including the millions of workers receiving aid under emergency federal programs, some 7.3 million Americans were receiving unemployment benefits as of Dec. 24, the most recent date for which comprehensive figures were available.\n",
      "However, analysts said the government might have had trouble adjusting the claims for seasonal fluctuations after the holiday shopping season.\n",
      "“We continue to view the labor market as gradually gaining momentum,” said Troy Davig, an economist at Barclays Capital.\n",
      "The unemployment rate in the United States has fallen sharply in recent months, to 8.5 percent in December, but some economists suspect the drop has in part resulted from discouraged workers dropping out of the labor force.\n",
      "The Commerce Department said total retail sales increased 0.1 percent in December, after rising by an upwardly revised 0.4 percent in November.\n",
      "Core retail sales, which exclude autos, gasoline and building materials, declined 0.1 percent in December, after advancing 0.3 percent a month earlier. Core sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the government’s gross domestic product report.\n",
      "Within the retail report, the government revised upward its estimate for November sales growth to 0.4 percent, suggesting consumers frontloaded their holiday shopping as retailers discounted heavily and extended store hours in the days after Thanksgiving. The government had initially estimated retail sales rose 0.2 percent in November.\n",
      "By the end of the season, however, consumers cut back, with spending at electronics and appliance stores down 3.9 percent in December. Shopping at department stores slipped 0.2 percent.\n",
      "Heavy discounting may have depressed retail sales for the entire season, said a JPMorgan economist, Michael Feroli, who also speculated that the slowdown in December could be because consumers realized they had spent too much in previous months.\n",
      "A recent drop in the saving rate has led many economists to think American shoppers were getting ahead of themselves.\n",
      "A 1.5 percent increase in sales of motor vehicles and parts helped lift the retail sector in December. Excluding autos, retail sales fell 0.2 percent, the first decline since May 2010.\n",
      "Another government report showed business inventories rose 0.3 percent in November, reinforcing the view that fourth-quarter economic growth could get a lift as companies restock their shelves.\n",

      "In a move sure to further strain relations between the United States and Venezuela , the State Department on Sunday said that it had ordered a Venezuelan diplomat based in Miami to leave the country.\n",
      "Officials declined to give a reason for the expulsion of the diplomat, Livia Acosta Noguera, Venezuela’s consul general in Miami.\n",
      "Last month a news report had asserted that Ms. Acosta had taken part in discussions about possible cyberattacks against the United States while she was stationed in the Venezuelan Embassy in Mexico.\n",
      "The report, broadcast on Univision, a Spanish-language network, included fragments of what it said were taped conversations with Ms. Acosta. In response to the report, several members of Congress called for an investigation and for the expulsion of Ms. Acosta if the allegations were proved to be true.\n",
      "Efforts to reach officials at the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington or at the consulate in Miami were not successful. After the broadcast of the Univision report last month, the Venezuelan government dismissed it as false.\n",
      "William Ostick, a State Department spokesman, said the department had informed Venezuela on Friday that Ms. Acosta had been declared persona non grata. She was required to leave the country by Tuesday.\n",
      "The Univision report outlined a conspiracy that might seem at home in the pages of a fictional thriller. It featured members of a group identified as former Mexican university students who claimed to have taped conversations as far back as 2007 with officials at the Iranian and Venezuelan Embassies in Mexico in which they discussed possible cyberattacks on companies or nuclear power plants in the United States.\n",
      "The former students, who said they had never intended to undertake such attacks, claimed the idea had originated with the Cuban government.\n",
      "In one recording made by the former students, a person they identified as Ms. Acosta can be heard claiming that she could pass on information about the scheme to Venezuela’s president, Hugo Chávez.\n",
      "But the report offers no concrete evidence that either Iranian or Venezuelan officials took the would-be hackers seriously or that they intended to accept their offer.\n",
      "There was no indication that American officials had been able to substantiate the allegations aired by Univision. But the decision to expel the diplomat coincided with the Obama administration’s expression of disapproval for Venezuela’s willingness to maintain friendly relations with Iran, despite international efforts to isolate it over its nuclear program. On Sunday night, President Chávez was preparing to welcome President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran in Caracas on the first leg of a Latin American tour.\n",
      "Mr. Chávez has long used his ties with Iran as a way to taunt the United States, which he casts as an imperialist aggressor seeking to topple his socialist government.\n",
      "He expelled the American ambassador to Venezuela, Patrick D. Duddy, in September 2008, charging that the United States was backing a group of military officers plotting a coup against him. In response, the United States expelled the Venezuelan ambassador. At the same time it accused two top officials in Mr. Chávez’s government of involvement in drug trafficking. One of those officials, Gen. Henry Rangel Silva, was named defense minister by Mr. Chávez last week.\n",

      "OKLAHOMA CITY —As many as 31 points separated the Oklahoma City Thunder from the Knicks on Saturday night, but the gap between them could be measured in so many vivid ways: in talent, depth, athleticism, chemistry or cohesion.\n",
      "The Thunder simply had more of everything, and it showed in a 104-92 victory that was so much more lopsided than the scoreboard could indicate. Kevin Durant dominated, Russell Westbrook preened and James Harden drilled shot after shot, putting the game away by the middle of the third quarter, while James L. Dolan — the Madison Square Garden chairman — watched grumpily from a baseline seat.\n",
      "Carmelo Anthony, the Knicks’ most dynamic player, watched from the bench, resting a sprained right ankle. But even at full strength, the Knicks might have been no match for the Thunder’s spry, young lineup, which may be the best in the Western Conference.\n",
      "The Thunder’s core players are in their third season together and fit together seamlessly. The Knicks’ roster was slapped together over the past 12 months and is still full of holes, despite the star power of Anthony, Amar’e Stoudemire and Tyson Chandler.\n",
      "“It’s a new team for us, and those guys have been together for a while,” Stoudemire said. “And their chemistry and their camaraderie goes a long way. We got to definitely gain some experience.”\n",
      "In the meantime, there will be humiliating nights like this. Durant scored 28 points in three quarters, hardly breaking a sweat as he converted 10 of 13 shots and all seven of his free throws. Harden had 24 points, going 8 for 12. Westbrook (21 points) also put on a show, blowing on his fingers as if they were smoking guns, then “holstering” them at his sides.\n",
      "If the Knicks were offended, they did not show it, or do anything to make Westbrook reconsider.\n",
      "“You can do what you want when you’re winning,” said Bill Walker, who started in Anthony’s place. “It was up to us to stop him, and we didn’t. That’s what happens when you don’t.”\n",
      "So the Knicks (6-6) dropped back to .500 and lost for the fourth straight time here. They have not won a road game against the Thunder since the franchise relocated from Seattle in 2008. The Thunder (11-2) showed why they are widely favored to win the Western Conference, dominating from start to finish. They led by 23 points at halftime, and by 31 midway through the third quarter, allowing the starting lineup to take the fourth quarter off.\n",
      "With Anthony out, the Knicks’ scoring burden fell primarily to Stoudemire, but he mustered only 14 points, missed 12 of 19 shots and committed 5 turnovers, continuing his perplexing early-season struggles. Chandler and Toney Douglas added 14 points each.\n",
      "“It’s a little bit tough when teams are just loading up on you,” Stoudemire said of opposing defenses. “They’re playing you to drive and guys are already sagging in, and they know you’re going to shoot the shots, so they’re contested shots. It’s not easy right now.”\n",
      "Before tipoff, Anthony sat at his locker, gold-colored headphones over his ears, his eyes closed and his arms crossed — a picture of private contemplation or quiet frustration. He said his ankle was still tender and made no predictions about playing Monday against the Orlando Magic. He has yet to try running or cutting.\n",
      "“It’s frustrating,” he said, adding with a wry smile, “I mean, you see me over there sitting in the corner. I’m hibernating over here.”\n",
      "Dolan — who pushed through the trade for Anthony last February — stopped here on the way back from a business trip, only to see his prized small forward take the night off.\n",
      "Things could become worse in the week ahead, with a tough four-game homestand that concludes with a visit by the Denver Nuggets, Anthony’s former team. The Nuggets (8-4) have fared far better since the trade last February than the Knicks, who are still shuffling players and adjusting to an overhauled roster.\n",
      "Mike Bibby drew his first start at point guard Saturday, in place of the struggling Iman Shumpert. Coach Mike D’Antoni said it was probably temporary, and a product of matchups, but he also did not guarantee that Shumpert would return to point guard.\n",
      "With Bibby, the Knicks had their fourth starting lineup, and their third starter at point guard, a position that will remain unstable until Baron Davis gets healthy.\n",
      "The offense still sputtered, with the Knicks shooting 41 percent from the field and Shumpert going 3 for 10, for 6 points. Bibby finished with 6 points and 3 assists. Jared Jeffries also returned after a 10-game absence and missed all four of his field-goal attempts.\n",
      "“It’s just going to take a while,” D’Antoni said, sounding uncomfortable repeating the theme. “Almost always, we got at least one or two rookies on the floor and without a training camp — it’s just excuse, excuse. I don’t want to do that. Were just struggling right now a little bit.”\n",

      "These are fragments of David Kato, glimpses of a Ugandan activist and friend who – one year ago today – was brutally murdered. These moments offer a perspective on the inner world that David shared with us, a world teeming with passion and relentless determination, good humor and vivid daydreams.\n",
      "During our first days in Kampala, a member of Parliament told us, “there is no longer a debate in Uganda as to whether homosexuality is right or not – it is not.” From what we knew of the pending Anti-Homosexuality Bill – which proposed death for H.I.V.-positive gay men and prison for anyone who failed to turn in a known homosexual – we were tempted to believe him.\n",
      "But David showed us a different reality. Initially, he played something of a fixer, our main liaison with the L.G.B.T., or “kuchu” community. We soon realized, however, that the man known as the “grandfather of the kuchus” was one of the most outspoken and inspired activists in East Africa. The more time we spent documenting his work, the more evident it became that, contrary to the M.P.’s claim, David and his fellow activists were, in fact, generating real debate in Uganda. Kampala’s kuchus had begun to dismantle the country’s discriminatory status quo, and were working tirelessly to change their fate and that of others across Africa.\n",
      "Today, as we revisit our memories of David, we remember his fortitude and remarkable legal achievements, boldly guided by his vision of establishing a Ugandan gay village. But perhaps most of all we recall these words, spoken with more logic than defiance: “If we keep on hiding, they will say we are not here.”\n",

      "To the usual lineup of beer and car commercials on Super Bowl Sunday, add this: one about player safety.\n",
      "For the first time, the N.F.L., currently the target of more than a dozen lawsuits accusing it of deliberately concealing information about the effects on players of repeated hits to the head, will use one minute of its own commercial time during its signature event to address player safety, its most critical and sobering problem.\n",
      "“It is your biggest stage, you’ve got a massive audience, a massive casual audience, and this topic is probably one of most important topics for casual fans, particularly mothers,” Mark Waller, the N.F.L.’s chief marketing officer, said about the decision to inject a serious subject into the league’s over-the-top party. “And so the possibility that we could actually address the issue in a constructive, engaging way with that audience makes it definitely worth the challenge. It’s a risk, without a doubt.”\n",
      "The N.F.L. spent several million dollars on the commercial and the creation of an accompanying Web site — nfl.com/evolution — that will go online Sunday and give detailed information about the history of the game and various rules changes. By using 60 of the 150 seconds of advertising time it is allotted during NBC’s telecast of the Super Bowl, the N.F.L. is taking away time it could use to promote other aspects of its business, including more traditional subjects like the NFL Network. (The average cost for 30 seconds of ad time during the Super Bowl is $3.5 million.)\n",
      "The decision was initially met with skepticism and concern by some league executives. Among those who supported the idea, according to Waller, were two owners of the teams that will play Sunday, John Mara of the Giants and Robert K. Kraft of the Patriots.\n",
      "Michael Hausfeld, a Washington-based lawyer who is representing some former players involved in concussion-related lawsuits against the N.F.L., said he had not seen the commercial. But when told about its message, he said an attempt to artfully portray the N.F.L. as having been concerned about player safety for decades, and doing all it can now to protect players, was “obscuring the reality.”\n",
      "“I’m troubled by it to the extent that it seeks to portray a position of concern when they really had none,” Hausfeld said in a telephone interview. “They shouldn’t be focused on placing ads. They should be focused on talking to those players who have suffered the concussions and the consequences. And saying, ‘What is it we can do?’\n",
      "“To a lot of people, the ad will resonate that they’re trying. On the other hand, there’s a little bit too much protesting. You’re trying to put yourself in too good of a light. Why? You’re trying to deflect your exposure.”\n",
      "The commercial, directed by Peter Berg — who created the TV program “Friday Night Lights” — will be shown during the final commercial break of the third quarter. It uses one long kick return as a way to take viewers through the evolution of the game’s rules and equipment, from the sport’s beginnings on a muddy field in Canton, Ohio, when players wore no helmets or pads, to the present in a brightly lighted Soldier Field.\n",
      "At one point, a leather helmet peels back to reveal a more modern one made of plastic. Later, a player grabs an opponent’s face mask, a violation of current rules.\n",
      "Only the most devoted fan would recognize all the references. The flying wedge, a blocking technique that is believed to have made its debut in 1892 but was banned soon after, is shown briefly in the opening seconds.

      "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela plans to leave the World Bank’s international arbitration body and try to settle disputes with foreign companies within its own judicial system, Rafael Ramírez, the country’s oil minister, said Sunday.\n",
      "Mr. Ramírez also announced that Venezuela would seek to renegotiate dozens of international investment-related agreements.\n",
      "“We do not accept impositions and we are going to rescue our national sovereignty,” Mr. Ramírez said in a televised interview.\n",

      "“You know those big paydays on Wall Street?” he says, typically waiting a beat to deliver the punch line. “I have something to do with them.”\n",
      "Mr. Johnson, a consultant who speaks with a light twang from his native Alabama, has never worked for a bank. Nor will his company, Johnson Associates, pay million-dollar bonuses to any of its 12 employees this year. But as one of the nation’s foremost financial compensation specialists, Mr. Johnson is among a small group of behind-the-scenes information brokers who help determine how Wall Street firms distribute billions of dollars to their workers.\n",
      "“The misunderstanding many people have about this industry is that pay is whimsical,” Mr. Johnson said in a recent interview at his company’s Manhattan office. “It’s not.”\n",
      "Compensation consulting is an obscure corner of the management consulting industry, where practitioners operate in the shadows of high finance. Large Wall Street banks, as well as hedge funds and private equity shops, rely on such consultants to help them structure bonus payouts and devise severance packages, and to provide data on what competitors pay.\n",
      "“You can give them some insights,” Mr. Johnson said of his clients, who have included the boards of Credit Suisse and Lehman Brothers. “You can say to them, ‘You’re being too wimpy this time,’ or, ‘You were being too aggressive last time.’ ”\n",
      "This year’s bonus season, which began in late December and will continue until February at some companies, is expected to be the worst for industry employees since 2008, as regulatory measures and economic uncertainty have cut deeply into profits and made pay pools smaller.\n",
      "In his annual compensation survey, a closely watched report that was sent to roughly 800 of the company’s clients in November, Mr. Johnson estimated that bonuses in the industry would fall 20 to 30 percent from last year’s levels.\n",
      "That would still leave employees at firms like Goldman Sachs, where the average worker took home $430,700 in total compensation in 2010, much better off than workers in other industries. But it would represent further slippage from the sector’s highs before the crisis.\n",
      "Bonus math in a financial downturn is a delicate art. Because the payments typically make up at least half of an employee’s yearly pay, erring on the low side can mean losing a star performer to a rival firm.\n",
      "“Someone on Wall Street might go apoplectic when he heard he got $3 million and another guy got $3.5 million,” Mr. Johnson said.\n",
      "Decades ago, banks determined bonuses according to a relatively simple formula that took into account an employee’s seniority and performance. After the financial crisis, as politicians and regulators began criticizing what they saw as eye-popping pay packages, those all-cash bonuses went out of fashion.\n",
      "Now, Wall Street pay packages routinely include deferred cash payments and restricted stock awards that can be redeemed only after multiyear waiting periods.\n",
      "The increased complexity of Wall Street compensation has been a boon for consulting businesses, which can charge hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for advice. Goldman Sachs has used the consultancy Semler Brossy; Morgan Stanley’s directors have relied on the Hay Group; and Bank of America’s board has used the services of Frederic W. Cook & Company, according to public filings by those banks. All three consulting companies, and all three banks, declined to comment.\n",
      "Some consultants are hired by banks merely to provide data on industry compensation trends, or to rubber-stamp the decisions of the banks’ internal compensation teams, while others are more directly involved in setting pay levels.\n",
      "“Directors don’t want to be embarrassed in the media by a compensation decision,” said Yale D. Tauber, a compensation consultant who works with the board of Citigroup, among other clients. “They’re the guardians of investors’ capital.”\n",

      "Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said Tuesday that he would veto a bill legalizing same-sex marriage , and he challenged the State Legislature instead to put the issue on the ballot for voters to decide.\n",
      "Democrats, who control the Legislature, swiftly rejected the idea, accusing the governor, a Republican, of trying to punt on a politically sensitive issue.\n",
      "“Marriage equality isn’t like sports betting,” said Senator Raymond Lesniak, a Union County Democrat, referring to a referendum on an amendment to the State Constitution on gambling last year. “It’s a civil right, which is already guaranteed in our Constitution. It’s up to the Legislature to guarantee these rights.”\n",
      "The same-sex marriage bill is a priority for Democrats, led by the Senate president, Stephen M. Sweeney, who has said that his decision not to vote on a similar bill two years ago, when there was a Democratic governor who supported same-sex marriage, was “the biggest mistake” of his political career.\n",
      "Gay-rights advocates had been hoping that Mr. Christie, who supports civil unions over same-sex marriage, might sign the legislation, or, if he vetoed it, give Republican legislators tacit approval to vote for an override.\n",
      "Mr. Christie is considered a rising national star in a party still dominated by socially conservative voters who oppose same-sex marriage. But he had been uncharacteristically noncommittal in recent weeks. On Monday, he nominated a gay man to the State Supreme Court, and when asked about the prospects for the marriage bill, said that he would make a decision if and when the bill ever reached his desk.\n",
      "He made his proposal on Tuesday after a town-hall-style meeting in Bridgewater, suggesting that the ballot question be presented to voters as a constitutional amendment. “The fact is, we’re discussing huge change, and I believe we need to approach this not only in a thoughtful way, not in a rushed way, but also in a way where we’re able to get the most input that we can from the public,” he said.\n",
      "The news was quickly conveyed to Republicans at a crowded hearing on the marriage legislation in Trenton. Senator Christopher Bateman, a Republican from Somerset County who some Democrats had been hoping would support the bill, announced Mr. Christie’s stance about an hour into the hearing and said he agreed with it.\n",
      "“Get this issue for once and all decided,” Mr. Bateman said.\n",
      "Senator Sweeney, a Gloucester County Democrat, shot back: “Civil rights will not be placed on the ballot.” When the crowd at the hearing applauded, he added: “We don’t need to wait for an answer. We just got one.”\n",
      "The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the same-sex marriage bill, 8-4.\n",
      "“When the governor was doing his town hall meetings, I can’t tell you how many times he said, ‘Call your legislator, I want to make these changes;’ ” Mr. Sweeney said in an interview later. “Why would he put this on the ballot when everything that’s been important in this state in the last two years has been handled by the Legislature?”\n",
      "Mr. Christie’s move also disappointed gay-rights advocates, who had just on Monday been effusive in their praise for his nominating Bruce Harris, who will be the state’s first openly gay Supreme Court justice if confirmed.\n",
      "A poll released by Quinnipiac University last week found that 52 percent of New Jersey voters believed that same-sex couples should have the right to marry, and 53 percent believed that denying them that right constituted discrimination. But across the country, the right to same-sex marriage has been granted mostly by court decision or legislative action. Same-sex-marriage advocates noted that almost every one of more than 30 ballot questions on gay rights had failed to broaden them; even in 2008, when the country elected a Democratic president, voters in California approved Proposition 8, banning same-sex marriage.\n",
      "“It’s a hard dynamic to win at the polls,” said Assemblyman Reed Gusciora, a Trenton Democrat who is openly gay. “At the end of the day, gays are a minority and they can’t match the crazies, who are out there and really motivated to vote against it.”\n",
      "Democrats argued that the last time the state placed a civil rights issue on the ballot was in 1915, when voters — then limited to men — considered whether to allow women to vote, and rejected the proposal.\n",
      "A separate move for same-sex marriage is proceeding through the courts in New Jersey. In 2006, the State Supreme Court ruled that gay couples had the same rights as heterosexual married couples, but left it up to the Legislature to decide how to ensure those rights.\n",
      "The Legislature passed a law allowing civil unions, but gay couples have sued, arguing that it fails to provide equal rights.\n",

      "IT’S that time again. Start filing all those W-2s, 1099s and scraps of paper you’ll need for your annual tax return. No doubt, this isn’t your favorite activity. At some point, you may ask yourself whether there’s a better way.\n",
      "There is. Economists who study public finance have long agreed with William E. Simon, the former Treasury secretary, who said that “the nation should have a tax system that looks like someone designed it on purpose.” Here are four principles of tax reform that most of those economists would endorse:\n",
      "BROADEN THE BASE AND LOWER RATES The United States tax code is filled with deductions and exclusions that shrink the basis of taxation. The smaller base in turn requires higher tax rates to raise the revenue needed to fund government. The starting point of reform is to reverse this process.\n",
      "This principle was endorsed both by President George W. Bush’s tax reform commission in 2005 and by President Obama’s deficit reduction commission in 2010. Neither report had much impact, because eliminating deductions and exclusions is politically treacherous. Yet each made a good case on the merits.\n",
      "Consider the deduction for mortgage interest. The policy is politically popular, but economists have long thought it has little justification. Because of this provision, among others, our tax system gives a better treatment to residential capital than it does to corporate capital. As a result, too much of the nation’s saving ends up in the form of housing rather than in business investment, where it could have increased productivity and wages.\n",
      "This efficiency cost might be worth bearing if the deduction had a benefit from the standpoint of equality, but it fails there as well. Subsidies to homeowners are, in effect, penalties on renters — after all, someone has to pick up the tab. But there is nothing wrong with renting. And once one acknowledges that renters are poorer, on average, than homeowners, the mortgage interest deduction becomes even harder to justify.\n",
      "TAX CONSUMPTION RATHER THAN INCOME Almost four centuries ago, the philosopher Thomas Hobbes suggested that taxes should be based on consumption, not income. Income measures a person’s contribution of labor and capital to society’s production of goods and services. Consumption measures the quantity of those goods and services he gets to enjoy. Hobbes reasoned that because consumption better reflects the benefits a person receives as a member of society, it is the proper basis of taxation.\n",
      "Much modern economic theory confirms that conclusion. In standard models, a consumption tax allows the economy to achieve the best allocation of resources over time, whereas an income tax needlessly discourages saving, investment and economic growth.\n",
      "Moving to a consumption tax might seem to require wholesale reform of our current system. But such a politically difficult step isn’t necessary. In fact, as our tax system has evolved over many years, legislators have come to appreciate the logic of taxing consumption, if only implicitly.\n",
      "The United States now has an income tax, or at least that is what it is called. But because many Americans do most of their saving through tax-preferred accounts, such as I.R.A.’s and 401(k) plans, they in effect pay taxes based on how much they consume. Tax reform could expand and simplify the availability of such tax-preferred savings accounts. In this way, our progressive income tax could further evolve toward a progressive consumption tax.\n",
      "TAX BADS RATHER THAN GOODS A good rule of thumb is that when you tax something, you get less of it. That means that taxes on hard work, saving and entrepreneurial risk-taking impede these fundamental drivers of economic growth. The alternative is to tax those things we would like to get less of.\n",
      "Consider the tax on gasoline. Driving your car is associated with various adverse side effects, which economists call externalities. These include traffic congestion, accidents, local pollution and global climate change. If the tax on gasoline were higher, people would alter their behavior to drive less. They would be more likely to take public transportation, use car pools or live closer to work. The incentives they face when deciding how much to drive would more closely match the true social costs and benefits.\n",
      "Economists who have added up all the externalities associated with driving conclude that a tax exceeding $2 a gallon makes sense. That would provide substantial revenue that could be used to reduce other taxes. By taxing bad things more, we could tax good things less.\n",
      "KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID This engineering aphorism is based on the timeless insight that complex systems are more likely to break down, often in ways the designer failed to anticipate. It applies with force to tax systems.\n",
      "Indeed, unlike engineering systems, complex tax systems go awry because an army of highly paid accountants and tax lawyers is ready to take advantage of any loophole it can find. Remember when President Obama’s stimulus plan offered tax credits for electric cars? Suddenly, the sale of golf carts took off.\n",
      "To be sure, any tax system will be subject to gaming, which is why we will always need the Internal Revenue Service. But the more we use narrowly targeted taxes and tax breaks, the more gaming there will be.\n",
      "Filling out tax returns will never be a delight. But if reform included simplification, the task might become a bit less onerous. And if a few accountants and tax lawyers were induced to become engineers and doctors instead, society will have moved a big step in the right direction.\n",

      "BACK in 1940, a popular book about Wall Street asked, “Where are the customers’ yachts?” Investment firms, it lamented, always seemed to win, even when their customers lost.\n",
      "True then and, all too often, true now — with rare exceptions. One of them was the case of Gerald D. Hosier and Jerry Murdock Jr., who invested millions with Citigroup, lost big — and came back swinging.\n",
      "Documents related to the case show how Citigroup pushed exotic investments as safe alternatives to humdrum municipal bonds. The paperwork, which was unsealed recently, makes for fascinating, if disheartening reading.\n",
      "First, some background. Mr. Hosier and Mr. Murdock are the kind of customers everyone in the investment business covets. Which is to say, they’re prosperous. The two were clients of Citigroup’s wealth management business, which, like its counterparts at other investment firms, takes a particular interest in high-net-worth people.\n",
      "But Mr. Hosier and Mr. Murdock were not happy customers. They accused Citigroup of fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, saying they had been misled about complex, risky investments that Citigroup had held out as safe and sound.\n",
      "Last April, a securities arbitration panel agreed with them. The men won the largest sum ever awarded to individuals in such a proceeding — a total of $54.1 million. Most of that was compensation for their losses. But some $17 million consisted of punitive damages. An additional $3 million went to cover legal fees.\n",
      "Given that harsh judgment, something about this case clearly disturbed the arbitrators. But because such proceedings are confidential, outsiders didn’t know the details — until, that is, Citigroup asked a United States district court to overturn the award.\n",
      "Now almost all of the documents the arbitrators saw have been unsealed. In late December, Judge Christine M. Arguello, in the District of Colorado, ruled against Citigroup and affirmed the award. So what do the documents show? Among other things, that Citigroup itself viewed these investments as risky. On its internal scale of 1 to 5 — 1 being the safest, 5 the riskiest — this stuff was rated 5. The filings also show how Citigroup tried to deflect problems when the investments began to sour.\n",
      "Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for Citigroup, said in a statement that the bank acted appropriately in creating and selling the investments, municipal arbitrage portfolios known as ASTA/MAT.\n",
      "“Our disclosures were accurate and complete and detailed the risks associated with investing in these products,” Ms. Romero-Apsilos said. Clients who bought the instruments “signed subscription agreements in which they expressly acknowledged the risks associated with this investment.”\n",
      "Only high-net-worth customers could participate, and they had to put up at least $500,000. In cases like this, banks typically argue that such wealthy, sophisticated investors know a gamble when they see one.\n",
      "This time, that argument failed, and it’s not hard to see why. The lawyer for the investors, Philip M. Aidikoff, of Aidikoff, Uhl & Bakhtiari, has won numerous cases against Citi involving these strategies and represents investors in scores of others yet to be decided.\n",
      "Internal sales memos produced in the arbitration describe the ASTA/MAT as ideal for customers seeking alternatives to fixed-income investments.\n",
      "“Our goal is NOT to target hedge fund clients who are willing to accept an unrestricted risk profile,” one internal document said, “but larger traditional fixed-income investors who are seeking alternatives and customized solutions without materially altering their risk characteristics.”\n",
      "But internal Citigroup e-mails were far clearer about potential risks. In early 2008, a few days after the investments started plummeting, Sallie Krawcheck, then head of wealth management at Citigroup, sent an e-mail asking for the risk rating of MAT, part of a family of investments know as “alternatives.”\n",
      "“Alternatives are always in 3-5,” came the response. A rating of 5 was usually reserved for potentially volatile products that carried the risk that clients could lose their entire investment, or more.\n",

      "It is a longstanding arrangement for the men and women who work on New York City’s transportation system: devote decades of work and labor to the upkeep of bridges, roads and railways, and receive a lifetime of free rides in return.\n",
      "This no-fare, no-toll, no-problem policy, currently enjoyed by more than 30,000 retirees, is so deeply ingrained in the culture of the region’s transit workers that when it abruptly disappeared from one agency, 400 beneficiaries signed onto a class-action lawsuit filed last month to get it back.\n",
      "The suit, filed against the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey after it eliminated free tolls and airport parking for 3,900 retirees, has prompted deeply personal recriminations on both sides. And it has thrown a spotlight onto the question of whether such public-sector perks can survive in this era of austerity.\n",
      "It is not the first time that free rides for transit workers have caused an uproar. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has suggested that free passes for bus and subway workers were too extravagant for a cash-starved state. And Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, while serving as attorney general, threatened to sue the Metropolitan Transportation Authority if it did not eliminate free tolls and fares for retired members of its board, a cherished perk.\n",
      "But rank-and-file transit workers say their benefits, which also extend to thousands of current employees around the region, are hard-earned, and are no different from a Bloomingdale’s clerk receiving a discount on clothes.\n",
      "At the transportation authority, by far the region’s largest transit operator, the free rides have been written into labor contracts for decades. At last count, 17,191 retirees from New York City Transit use free MetroCards to ride the city’s subways and buses. Many more retired workers are eligible, but do not take advantage because they have moved away from the city, according to union officials.\n",
      "More than 9,000 retirees at the Long Island Rail Road and at Metro-North Railroad are allowed to ride the trains free, although not for daily commuting, and about 1,300 retired New Jersey Transit workers enjoy the same perk. E-ZPass is used by 1,100 retired workers at the authority’s bridges and tunnels unit for free passage at major crossings, including the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.\n",
      "The transportation authority has no current plans to try to take away the lifetime passes in its upcoming contract negotiations with bus and subway workers. But the New York State Thruway Authority eliminated the benefit from its labor contracts in 2005, although about 1,500 workers hired before that date still have free rein of the agency’s roadways.\n",
      "The Port Authority, which had offered the retirement perk since before the 1970s, rescinded the benefit for many retirees in late 2010. That was when Thomas Westfield, a retired authority police sergeant who filed the class-action suit, discovered he could no longer use the George Washington Bridge and the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels free.\n",
      "“There was certainly no due process at all,” said Mr. Westfield, now 65 and a lawyer in New Jersey. “We weren’t notified; there was no hearing. Just, boom — it happened.”\n",
      "Mr. Westfield said he felt betrayed: he said the promised free rides had been a factor in his decision to take a job at the Port Authority when he returned from military service in 1971.\n",
      "The Port Authority seems to be taking the case just as personally as Mr. Westfield. In a terse statement on Thursday, its executive director called the lawsuit “offensive to me” and threatened to force the plaintiffs to pay back taxes on the rides.\n",
      "Retirees are not the only workers losing the benefit. Last year, the New York Legislature passed a bill to bar current state employees from traveling on the Thruway for nonwork reasons without paying, calling it an “odious practice” that cost taxpayers $14 million a year.\n",
      "Perhaps the most public fight over free rides came in 2008, when Metropolitan Transportation Authority board members — for the most part, a wealthy and well-connected group — nearly revolted over Mr. Cuomo’s insistence that they give up their free passes. (Mr. Cuomo said the passes violated a rule against providing compensation to the board. The free passes were eventually eliminated.)\n",
      "David S. Mack, a board member from Long Island, told reporters then that he was incensed at the prospect of losing his commuter train pass: “Why should I ride and inconvenience myself when I can ride in a car?”\n",
      "A retired board member, Warren S. Dolny, said at the time that the loss of the free rides would significantly affect his way of life. Reached by telephone this week at his new home in Florida, Mr. Dolny, 83, said he had not changed his mind.\n",
      "“The amount of monies we were talking about for all the board members didn’t amount to the size of a postage stamp on a football field,” Mr. Dolny said. “It’s $30,000 a year. With a budget of billions, what’s $30,000?”\n",

      "After months of standing by as Republicans tried to gut environmental laws and discredit his clean energy initiatives, President Obama took the offensive in his State of the Union address . He blasted Republicans for their single-minded commitment to fossil fuels, argued the case for a diversified energy strategy and dared to talk about climate change, a topic he has been silent on for months.\n",
      "He has little chance of persuading Congress to go along with most of his sensible proposals, including those to extend and enlarge subsidies for alternative fuels and cut subsidies for the oil industry. He is right to do as much as he can on his own, opening up more federal land to wind and solar installations and pushing the military to draw more of its energy from renewable sources.\n",
      "The president has a history of making great speeches with frustratingly limited follow-through. We suspect that some of his campaign advisers — spooked by the pounding over the Solyndra bankruptcy filing and absurd Republican claims about losing tens of thousands of potential jobs from his denial of the environmentally risky Keystone XL oil pipeline — will be tempted to argue that the issue is a loser.\n",
      "There is a powerful case to be made that clean energy investments that will create real jobs and keep America competitive in a $5 trillion global market for advanced energy technologies. If the president doesn’t make it, the Republicans’ defense of big coal and oil will prevail.\n",
      "The lengthy Republican investigation into the failure of a single solar energy company, Solyndra, has already raised doubts about the value and integrity of a multibillion-dollar federal program designed to support renewable energy development. Mr. Obama had the right response: The failure of some public investments to pan out was not reason enough to abandon clean energy or “cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany.” It’s an argument he will have to keep making.\n",
      "We found particularly compelling his plain-speaking defense of regulation — and the way he implicitly linked the antiregulatory folks who brought down the banking system (and their corporate pals) with the folks fighting environmental regulations (and their corporate pals). He vowed not to “back down” from rules aimed at preventing oil spills, rules protecting children from mercury poisoning, rules guaranteeing safe food and clean water.\n",
      "Mr. Obama agreed that a comprehensive strategy must include fossil fuels, and he pledged to promote natural gas and open up the outer continental shelf for oil exploration — both in an environmentally safe manner. This did not placate the Republicans. After the speech, their spokesmen immediately tried to steer the conversation back to the pipeline and the failure of Solyndra.

And what will replace them may provide fresh evidence that the city has traded its longtime rock ’n’ roll edge for something mellower, and a bit corporate.\n",
      "Southpaw, which will close its location at 125 Fifth Avenue in Brooklyn in February, will become a New York Kids Club, an activity center for children.\n",
      "Bleecker Bob’s will close its store at 118 West Third Street at the end of April, according to a manager, Chris Wiedener.\n",
      "“It’s kind of disappointing,” said Giancarlo Caccamo, 19, a customer at Bleecker Bob’s on Thursday evening, upon learning the news. The vinyl records that pack the wooden bins and milk crates in the cluttered, narrow space are an increasingly endangered species, said Mr. Caccamo, who was in search of a record by Mott the Hoople.\n",
      "The store’s closing seemed to sound a death knell for vinyl itself. “I just love the warm fuzz that you get,” he said. “There’s nothing like that sound.”\n",
      "Javier Medina, 43, who began shopping at Bleecker Bob’s in the 1970s and has worked there as a salesman for the last decade, was more concerned about the loss of a piece of history. “This place should be a landmark,” he said while chatting with Gary Rookard, 53, who sells glass pipes on a table outside. “Everybody in the world knows it.”\n",
      "Mr. Rookard, a 35-year Village resident, agreed but said the change fit the area’s continuing pattern of gentrification. “All that will be left down here are A.T.M.’s and bars, if anything,” he said.\n",
      "Bleecker Bob’s, which began as Village Oldies Records in 1968, on Bleecker Street, and moved to two other locations before ending up at No. 118, had many rock ’n’ roll moments. Jimmy Page, Led Zeppelin’s guitarist, tended the register there occasionally, as did Frank Zappa, according to employees, who said both musicians were friends with Bob Plotnick, the store’s owner.\n",
      "In the late 1970s, the store sold punk rock records when few other shops did, customers and employees remembered. Even the building itself, near Macdougal Street, brushed up against fame: in the 1960s, it was also home to the Night Owl Cafe, where the Lovin’ Spoonful often played, Mr. Wiedener said.\n",
      "What kept Bleecker Bob’s going for years was the back of the store, which was leased to a tattoo parlor, among other businesses, which helped pay the rent. But the last subtenant was a comic book store, which closed in 2008, Mr. Wiedener said, making it difficult to continue.\n",
      "“I’m sorry I personally couldn’t have done more,” Mr. Wiedener said as he priced a new batch of records, including Led Zeppelin’s “Houses of the Holy” ($20).\n",
      "The landlord, Greenwich Realty Associates of Long Island, did not return a call for comment.\n",
      "Southpaw, meanwhile, will close on Feb. 20, after a four-day series called Americana Pie, which will feature bluegrass and alternative country music.\n",
      "Its neighborhood, which was fairly dangerous a few decades ago, has rapidly added upscale shops and restaurants and become a magnet for families.\n",
      "Despite the area’s changing face, Matthew Roff, one of Southpaw’s owners, says he was not having a hard time filling the club during shows, which took place most nights.\n",

      "CHESTER, Pa. — The Chester Upland School District is more than $20 million in debt, its bank account is almost empty and it cannot afford to pay teachers past the end of this month.\n",
      "To make matters worse, the local charter school, with which the district must divide its financing, is suing the district over unpaid bills.\n",
      "The district’s fiscal woes are the product of a toxic brew of budget cuts, mismanagement and the area’s poverty. Its problems are compounded by the Chester Community Charter School, a nonprofit institution that is managed by a for-profit company and that now educates nearly half of the district’s students.\n",
      "The district sees the charter as a vampire, sucking up more than its fair share of scarce resources. The state, it says, is giving the charter priority over the district.\n",
      "“It’s not competition, it’s just draining resources from the district,” said Catherine Smith, a principal at Columbus Elementary, a district school. “It’s a charter school on steroids.”\n",
      "The charter says that it is also part of the public school system and that the district, its primary source of financing, has not paid it anything since last spring. The state has taken over payments, but even those are late, it says.\n",
      "Chester may be a harbinger of fiscal decline. At least six other Pennsylvania school districts are bordering on insolvency, according to State Representative Joseph F. Markosek, the Democratic chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.\n",
      "Chester’s troubles also show just how deeply budget cuts bite in poor districts. With a median household income of $26,000, just half of the state median, Chester has one of the state’s most meager tax bases. State financing makes up about 70 percent of its budget. For comparison, nearby Radnor Township, with a median household income of $85,000, draws just 10 percent of its school budget from state money, according to a town spokesman. The largest share is real estate taxes, at 83 percent.\n",
      "“Poor schools in this state are underfunded,” said Thomas Persing, acting deputy superintendent for the Chester Upland district. “Poor kids aren’t going to get the same shot as wealthy kids. That’s the society we are in now.”\n",
      "But the district has been troubled for years. The state took over its finances in 1994 but has since handed control back to the community. Five state administrations, including the current one of Gov. Tom Corbett, a Republican, have been unable to fix the district. Budget cuts may be painful, the state argues, but they are not the root of the district’s problems.\n",
      "In December, Mr. Corbett refused to advance the district emergency money, saying it had mismanaged its budget. The district says that the state was in charge as receiver for years and that it left the district with a large debt when it handed back control in 2010.\n",
      "Whatever the case, the math was stark: the district could not afford to pay salaries.\n",
      "The district’s teachers tried to ease the pressure by voting to work without pay as long as they were able, a gesture that drew considerable attention. One of the district’s teachers, Sara Ferguson, was invited by Michelle Obama to attend the State of the Union address last month, and she appeared on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Thursday.\n",
      "Ultimately, a federal judge intervened in a separate lawsuit by the district, ordering the state to pay $3.2 million, enough to cover the salaries. In the end, pay was only two days late. Still, the district has money to cover only the next two pay periods. Money to pay vendors, like insurance companies and power suppliers, runs out in the middle of the month.\n",
      "“There have been money problems, but we’ve never been threatened like now,” said Ms. Ferguson, whose school, Columbus Elementary, was decorated with a poster by students congratulating her on being invited to the State of the Union address.\n",
      "On a recent Monday, students ran and shouted on the Columbus playground. In the latest round of budget cuts, the school lost its art teacher, its music teacher, its technology teacher, its staff person for the library and even the money for its fledgling band. “The children have gym, gym and gym,” Ms. Ferguson said.\n",
      "When Ms. Ferguson began teaching here in 1991, she was one of 11 fifth-grade teachers, she said. Now there are only two.\n",
      "The charter school initially had less than 100 students in 1998, but it has grown to more than 2,600 on two campuses. At its West Campus, a gate with lions on the front and the school’s initials, CCCS, on the painted black iron bars give the impression of a private school. Its wooden lockers are open shelves, and its offices have security cameras that watch every classroom. Each student in third to eighth grades was given an XO laptop, a computer designed to be used by students in developing countries.\n",

      "HONG KONG — As the White House prepares for a Washington visit by the man who is expected to run China for the coming decade, trade tensions between the United States and Beijing are on the rise.\n",
      "On Tuesday, a coalition of big American labor unions, Democratic politicians and trade advocacy groups plans to start campaigning for the Obama administration to file a series of trade cases against China in the auto industry. They accuse Beijing of unfairly subsidizing Chinese auto parts makers and illegally restricting the exports of crucial raw materials that foreign parts makers need to stay competitive.\n",
      "The group says a 900 percent increase in auto parts imports from China over the last decade, to nearly $12 billion a year, is to blame for job losses in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania — three swing states that the administration cannot easily ignore in a presidential election year.\n",
      "“The Chinese have cheated,” said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who is a Congressional leader of the trade effort along with Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan.\n",
      "The group has been preparing its campaign for months. But it may be sensing a new opportunity after President Obama signaled a tougher trade stance against China in his State of the Union address last week, saying he would set up a trade enforcement unit to investigate unfair Chinese practices.\n",
      "Separately, the Commerce Department is considering whether to levy punitive tariffs against China over green energy technology. And on Monday, Washington was on the winning side of a World Trade Organization ruling against China for its export restrictions on industrial minerals.\n",
      "All of which promises to test diplomacy on both sides during a Feb. 14 White House visit by China’s vice president, Xi Jinping, who is expected to succeed President Hu Jintao next winter as China’s leader.\n",
      "Chinese officials have vehemently denied that they violate international trade agreements. “Over the past 10 years, China has fully implemented its W.T.O. commitments, and its trade and investment liberalization and facilitation have been significantly increased,” President Hu said last month.\n",
      "Senator Brown said Washington’s appetite for a more assertive trade policy was whetted last month by China’s imposition of steep tariffs on $4.9 billion a year of imports of sport utility vehicles and large cars from the United States.\n",
      "Hoping to reduce the trade tensions just before Mr. Xi’s visit, Chinese officials are preparing to send at least six business delegations on buying trips to the United States, people familiar with the plans but not authorized to discuss them said. Similar delegations have preceded past visits by top Chinese leaders to Washington and have focused on bundling planned purchases of Boeing jets, American grain and other exports into multibillion-dollar contracts that can be signed at elaborate ceremonies.\n",
      "The Obama administration has also made a few small conciliatory moves. The Commerce Department planned to issue a preliminary ruling on Feb. 13 on whether to impose tariffs on Chinese solar panels to offset reported Chinese export subsidies. But when the United States and China agreed last week that Feb. 14 would be the date for Vice President Xi’s visit to Washington, the department pushed back its ruling until March 2.\n",
      "But small gestures may not overcome the shock among American trade officials and auto industry executives last month when China imposed the tariffs on American vehicles.\n",
      "An adviser to the Chinese commerce ministry, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to comment, said that decision had been based mostly on jockeying among Chinese factions over the need to show toughness toward the United States and did not signal a broader shift in Chinese policies.\n",
      "The Chinese move came as American labor unions, Democratic politicians, policy research groups and trade lawyers were already in the final stages of the auto parts campaign that they plan to announce in Washington on Tuesday. Besides numerous Democratic members of Congress, the coalition includes the United Steelworkers union, the United Automobile Workers union, the labor-backed Economic Policy Institute and the trade law firm Stewart & Stewart, as well as the Wessel Group, a trade strategy firm.\n",

      "Proposed changes in the definition of autism would sharply reduce the skyrocketing rate at which the disorder is diagnosed and might make it harder for many people who would no longer meet the criteria to get health, educational and social services, a new analysis suggests.\n",
      "The definition is now being reassessed by an expert panel appointed by the American Psychiatric Association, which is completing work on the fifth edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the first major revision in 17 years. The D.S.M., as the manual is known, is the standard reference for mental disorders, driving research, treatment and insurance decisions. Most experts expect that the new manual will narrow the criteria for autism; the question is how sharply.\n",
      "The results of the new analysis are preliminary, but they offer the most drastic estimate of how tightening the criteria for autism could affect the rate of diagnosis. For years, many experts have privately contended that the vagueness of the current criteria for autism and related disorders like Asperger syndrome was contributing to the increase in the rate of diagnoses — which has ballooned to one child in 100, according to some estimates.\n",
      "The psychiatrists’ association is wrestling with one of the most agonizing questions in mental health — where to draw the line between unusual and abnormal — and its decisions are sure to be wrenching for some families. At a time when school budgets for special education are stretched, the new diagnosis could herald more pitched battles. Tens of thousands of people receive state-backed services to help offset the disorders’ disabling effects, which include sometimes severe learning and social problems, and the diagnosis is in many ways central to their lives. Close networks of parents have bonded over common experiences with children; and the children, too, may grow to find a sense of their own identity in their struggle with the disorder.\n",
      "The proposed changes would probably exclude people with a diagnosis who were higher functioning. “I’m very concerned about the change in diagnosis, because I wonder if my daughter would even qualify,” said Mary Meyer of Ramsey, N.J. A diagnosis of Asperger syndrome was crucial to helping her daughter, who is 37, gain access to services that have helped tremendously. “She’s on disability, which is partly based on the Asperger’s; and I’m hoping to get her into supportive housing, which also depends on her diagnosis.”\n",
      "The new analysis, presented Thursday at a meeting of the Icelandic Medical Association, opens a debate about just how many people the proposed diagnosis would affect.\n",
      "The changes would narrow the diagnosis so much that it could effectively end the autism surge, said Dr. Fred R. Volkmar, director of the Child Study Center at the Yale School of Medicine and an author of the new analysis of the proposal. “We would nip it in the bud.”\n",
      "Experts working for the Psychiatric Association on the manual’s new definition — a group from which Dr. Volkmar resigned early on — strongly disagree about the proposed changes’ impact. “I don’t know how they’re getting those numbers,” Catherine Lord, a member of the task force working on the diagnosis, said about Dr. Volkmar’s report.\n",
      "Previous projections have concluded that far fewer people would be excluded under the change, said Dr. Lord, director of the Institute for Brain Development, a joint project of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Columbia University Medical Center and the New York Center for Autism.\n",
      "Disagreement about the effect of the new definition will almost certainly increase scrutiny of the finer points of the psychiatric association’s changes to the manual. The revisions are about 90 percent complete and will be final by December, according to Dr. David J. Kupfer, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh and chairman of the task force making the revisions.\n",
      "At least a million children and adults have a diagnosis of autism or a related disorder, like Asperger syndrome or “pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified,” also known as P.D.D.-N.O.S. People with Asperger’s or P.D.D.-N.O.S. endure some of the same social struggles as those with autism but do not meet the definition for the full-blown version. The proposed change would consolidate all three diagnoses under one category, autism spectrum disorder, eliminating Asperger syndrome and P.D.D.-N.O.S. from the manual. Under the current criteria, a person can qualify for the diagnosis by exhibiting 6 or more of 12 behaviors; under the proposed definition, the person would have to exhibit 3 deficits in social interaction and communication and at least 2 repetitive behaviors, a much narrower menu.\n",
      "Dr. Kupfer said the changes were an attempt to clarify these variations and put them under one name. Some advocates have been concerned about the proposed changes.\n",
      "“Our fear is that we are going to take a big step backward,” said Lori Shery, president of the Asperger Syndrome Education Network. “If clinicians say, ‘These kids don’t fit the criteria for an autism spectrum diagnosis,’ they are not going to get the supports and services they need, and they’re going to experience failure.”\n",

      "The good news, of course, is that they’re not all in one place. And none involve dead animals, maggots, encrusted diamonds or vats of formaldehyde. They’re mostly just grids of repeating, neatly made circles, each a different color. How bad can it be?\n",
      "Well, very bad at times, and yet, at others, not bad at all, in fact rather good. In New York, where 115 of the 331 are on view in the three Gagosian galleries in the city, the quality of the art — and the experience of it — varies tremendously. Parts of Hirst New York are both visually exhilarating and accessible; you can take the kids, take friends who have never looked at art or acquaintances curious about the formal principles of abstraction. Then there are parts so redundant and oppressive as to appeal to only hard-core Hirst devotees. The New York allotment, at least, is a sideshow but one with redeeming qualities, a spectacle with benefits, which is a lot more than can be said of Mr. Hirst’s previous attention-getting shenanigans, like the all-Hirst auctions or the bejeweled skull.\n",
      "Am I grading on a curve? Probably. Undoubtedly the usual knickers will be twisted by Mr. Hirst’s latest grandstanding: He’s so unimaginative, so crassly commercial, not a real artist and so forth. Mr. Hirst is the post-Warhol, post-Barnum epitome of the artist as impresario, public relations strategist, graphic designer and art director. You can find precedents for just about all of his actions in previous generations. Multiple-city gallery shows have been around since the 1980s; many artists have overproduced, and most are publicity minded. But he has rolled all this, and more, into one big, messy contradictory ball of wax and pushed it to extremes in ways that regularly drive people nuts.\n",
      "On one level, the Hirst à Gogo is a blatant promotion of both the Hirst and Gagosian brands, and a sitting-duck symbol of the end-time, we’re-doing-this-because-we-can decadence that has subsumed so much of the art world — yet another instance of money celebrating itself. The show is titled “Damien Hirst the Complete Spot Paintings 1986-2011,” and would that this were so. There are more than 1,500 of these things in existence; evidently they will all be accommodated in the show’s catalog, which will live up to the title. (This is not a tome I look forward to paging through.)\n",
      "But the spot-painting project is more complicated, even paradoxical. It challenges you to hold opposing ideas at the same time. Alongside the promotional character of the undertaking is an aspect of goofy honesty, generosity and even full disclosure. Mr. Hirst, or his assistants, have been making a lot of these paintings; so why not show a lot of them?\n",
      "The global presentation brings to mind a worldwide rollout for the latest iWhatever. Yet it also reminds me of a weird, commercial version of the Christos’ “Gates” in Central Park, only more spread out, with a lot less orange and greater visual interest. Over the next month or so people in New York, London, Paris, Geneva, Rome, Athens, Hong Kong and Beverly Hills can go to a Gagosian outpost and have a similar Hirst experience. Suggestion: Maybe Gagosian could enhance the collective nature of the experience by having all the galleries stay open around the clock.\n",
      "Not surprisingly the overblown, up-and-down quality of the whole extravaganza mirrors Mr. Hirst’s overblown, up-and-down career. Yet this is somewhat paradoxical given the narrow focus here. He is showing nothing but fields of enamel dots, smooth discs of color applied to white canvases in orderly grids at intervals equal to the diameter of the discs. The discs can be any color, except the colors can’t repeat on any given canvas (though they come extremely close), and the people making the paintings choose the colors.\n",
      "The relentless evenness of formula and technique reflects Mr. Hirst’s stated desire to make paintings that seem to have been made by a machine. Yet what’s striking is the unevenness, the variations of touch and finish, and the way that even within their narrow confines the spot paintings do the usual Hirst thing: that is, they range from good to atrocious. Some of them are wonderful; some aren’t really paintings, they’re just expanses of inert spots that happen to be hanging in a gallery. The fluctuations in quality is itself a kind of affirmation of the whole idea of quality.\n",

      "“I think there must be a place in the soul all made of tunes, of tunes of long ago,” Charles Ives wrote in “The Things Our Fathers Loved.” He set that poem to music as the 43rd entry in “114 Songs,” the collection he published in 1922, which was performed in a four-hour marathon on Saturday by the young, ambitious Brooklyn Art Song Society at Galapagos Art Space .\n",
      "Ives’s songs, like the rest of his work, mine, remix and infuse with his own inimitable, experimental sensibility those “tunes of long ago.” It’s a songbook of tremendous range — including but hardly limited to thunderous pronouncements, shining hymns, gentle ballads and vaudeville-style “character” tunes. That is not to mention spiky fusions of dissonance and homemade poetry that seem both to arise organically out of the American tradition and to remain stubbornly distant from it.\n",
      "The songs never quite follow the expected script. A recurring little flourish in the piano’s right hand keeps “Forward Into Light” from settling into just another hymn. Through canny adjustments of the meter, “The Last Reader” starts sweetly lyrical, then wanders before gathering itself back into a standard melody and then wandering again.\n",
      "In “Evidence” the vocal line begins almost as a surprise, starting on the upbeat rather than the traditional downbeat. The ending of “To Edith” comes just as surprisingly, vanishing into nothing.\n",
      "The collection is full of remarkable transformations of ordinary texts. “The Housatonic at Stockbridge” turns a sentimental, pastoral poem into a profound reflection on identity.\n",
      "In his note on the score of that song, Ives writes about trying to recreate for piano the effect he was seeking when he first set the music for orchestra. There he had the muted upper strings playing “as a kind of distant background of mists seen through the trees or over a river valley.” Similarly, in Ives’s work the comfortable past — parlor songs and marching bands, church hymns and genteel poetry — is seen as if from a misty distance, both recognized and reinvented.\n",
      "On Saturday six talented, hard-working singers — the sopranos Emily Riggs and Deborah van Renterghem, the mezzo-soprano Mary Nessinger, the tenors Brandon Snook and Paul Sperry, and the bass-baritone Robert Osborne — brought a variety of approaches but a unifying relish to Ives’s challenges and rewards. They were joined by the excellent pianists Michael Brofman, Marc Peloquin, Michael Rose and Miori Sugiyama.\n",
      "This is the second season for the Brooklyn Art Song Society, led by Mr. Brofman and Mr. Rose. It continues with a concert on Feb. 24, part of its new-music series In Context, featuring works by Yehudi Wyner alongside Barber and Shostakovich. In March comes the second installment in a continuing retrospective of the songs of Hugo Wolf. It is a company well worth watching.\n",

      "Ever since Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry started criticizing Mitt Romney’s actions at Bain Capital — and talking about the thousands of people laid off as a result of Bain’s investments — party leaders have essentially told them to shut up. That response is a pretty good indication of how deeply party elders fear the issue of economic inequality in the campaign to come.\n",
      "“What the hell are you doing, Newt?” Rudolph Giuliani asked Thursday on Fox News. “This is what Saul Alinsky taught Barack Obama, and what you’re saying is part of the reason we’re in so much trouble right now.”\n",
      "Mr. Giuliani has one thing right: Republicans are indeed in growing trouble as more voters begin to realize how much the party’s policies — dismantling regulations, slashing taxes for the rich, weakening unions — have contributed to inequality and the yawning distance between the middle class and the top end.\n",
      "The more President Obama talks about narrowing that gap, the more his popularity ratings have risen while those of Congress plummet. Two-thirds of Americans now say there is a strong conflict between the rich and the poor, according to a Pew survey released last week, making it the greatest source of tension in American society.\n",
      "That makes Mr. Romney and his party vulnerable, as he clearly knows. He said on Wednesday that issues of wealth distribution should be discussed only “in quiet rooms.” And he accused the president of using an “envy-oriented, attack-oriented” approach, “entirely inconsistent with the concept of one nation under God.”\n",
      "Mr. Romney’s image of a country where workers have nothing but admiration for benevolent, job-creating capitalists (and no one is so impolite as to mention jobs destroyed) bears very little relationship to reality. But his suggestion that it is un-American to talk about rising populist resentment is self-serving and hypocritical. Republicans, in particular, have eagerly stoked such resentments against minorities and the poor.\n",
      "That was the essence of the “Southern strategy” that Republicans, beginning with Richard Nixon, used to urge white voters to defect from a Democratic Party that supported civil rights. It continued for decades with attacks on busing, affirmative action, immigration and welfare, and was sounded most recently by Mr. Gingrich, with his attacks on Mr. Obama as “the food stamp president.”\n",
      "Fanning resentment of the poor — and deflecting attention from the relentless Republican defense of the rich — is also central to the party’s current political strategy. That’s why so many Republican candidates and lawmakers keep talking so angrily about poor people not paying federal income taxes. That’s how the Tea Party got started in 2009, when Mr. Obama proposed lowering interest rates for homeowners who were behind on their mortgages and conservative activists saw an opportunity to pit the affluent against their struggling neighbors. And that’s why Mr. Romney constantly accuses the president of trying to create “an entitlement society,” which is simply a variant on Ronald Reagan’s welfare-queen anecdotes.\n",
      "And yet if Democrats dare to point out that the income gains of the top 1 percent have dwarfed everyone else’s in the last few decades, they are accused of whipping up class envy. Alan Krueger, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, noted in a speech on Thursday that the median income in the United States had actually declined since 1999, shrinking the middle class while the income of the top 1 percent soared. Such inequality is corrosive. And pointing it out has nothing to do with envy and everything to do with pressing for policies to help America’s struggling middle class.\n",
      "Anyone who criticizes Mr. Romney’s business practices now faces the absurd charge of putting free-market capitalism on trial. No one is trying to end capitalism, but President Obama is calling for more effective regulation to protect consumers. While Republicans attack a supposed “entitlement culture,” Mr. Obama is calling for strengthening a desperately needed safety net. And he is calling for raising taxes on the wealthy, particularly for those on Wall Street and in private equity, to protect that safety net and reduce the deficit.\n",
      "Mr. Romney has based his campaign on his business experience. Americans need to know how that experience was gained, and what values — if any — it represents. Class reality has nothing to do with class warfare.\n",

      "Joe Paterno , who won more games than any other major-college football coach, and who became the face of Pennsylvania State University and a symbol of integrity in collegiate athletics only to be fired during the 2011 season amid a child sexual abuse scandal that reverberated throughout the nation, died Sunday in State College, Pa. He was 85.\n",
      "His family announced his death in a statement released Sunday morning. The cause was lung cancer, according to Mount Nittany Medical Center, where he had been treated. Paterno’s family announced in mid-November that he had received a diagnosis of lung cancer after a visit to a physician regarding a bronchial illness a few days earlier. He lived in State College.\n",
      "During his 46 years as head coach, as he paced the sideline in his thick tinted glasses, indifferent to fashion in his white athletic socks and rolled-up baggy khaki pants, Paterno seemed as much a part of the Penn State landscape as Mount Nittany, overlooking the central Pennsylvania campus known as Happy Valley.\n",
      "When Penn State defeated Illinois, 10-7, on Oct. 29, 2011, the victory was Paterno’s 409th, and he surpassed Eddie Robinson of Grambling for most career victories among N.C.A.A. Division I coaches. Penn State’s president at the time, Graham B. Spanier, presented Paterno with a commemorative plaque in a postgame ceremony shown on the huge scoreboard at Beaver Stadium.\n",
      "It would be Paterno’s last game. Within days his former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky was indicted and arrested on multiple charges of sexually abusing young boys extending back to his time on Paterno’s staff. On Nov. 9, Paterno and Spanier were fired by the university’s board of trustees because of their failure to go to the police after they were told of an accusation against Sandusky in 2002.\n",
      "Paterno’s abrupt firing at 84 was something that could hardly have been imagined, although he had stubbornly clung to the spotlight at an age when most head coaches, whatever their renown, had retired.\n",
      "He had held himself to an exceedingly high standard with what he called his “grand experiment”: fielding outstanding teams with disciplined players whose graduation rates far exceeded that at most football powers. His football program had never been tainted by a recruiting scandal. His statue stood outside Beaver Stadium alongside the legend “Educator, Coach, Humanitarian.”\n",
      "Former players who succeeded in professional life far beyond the football field had told of their debt to him.\n",
      "“Look how many go to medical school or law school,” said Bill Lenkaitis, a dentist in Foxborough, Mass., who played for Paterno in the 1960s and became a longtime center for the New England Patriots. “Look how many become heads of corporations.”\n",
      "Many a Pennsylvania home was stocked with Paterno knickknacks: Cup of Joe coffee mugs, Stand-up Joe life-size cutouts, JoePa golf balls bearing his likeness.\n",
      "Paterno and his wife, Sue, were major benefactors of Penn State. During his nearly half-century as head coach, donors gave hundreds of millions of dollars to the university, helping to shape it into a major research institution, seemingly an outgrowth of his having made Penn State a national brand name through its football teams.\n",
      "All-Americans by the Dozen\n",
      "Paterno was a five-time national coach of the year. He had five unbeaten and untied teams, and he coached Penn State to the No. 1 ranking in 1982 and 1986. He took his Nittany Lions to 37 bowl games, winning 24 of them, and turned out dozens of first-team all-Americans.\n",
      "On Saturday afternoons at Beaver Stadium, crowds exceeding 100,000 cheered on Nittany Lions players recruited by Paterno largely from Pennsylvania and nearby states. Many went on to stellar professional careers, among them running backs Franco Harris and Lydell Mitchell and linebacker Jack Ham.\n",
      "Paterno had a career record of 409 victories, 136 defeats and 3 ties. He was surpassed only by John Gagliardi, who has won 484 games at Carroll College in Montana and St. John’s of Minnesota, coaching below the major-college level.\n",

      "Fuel-cell cars are regarded as zero emission because they don’t emit anything but water vapor from their tailpipes.They use the same basic drivetrains as electric vehicles, but in lieu of batteries they substitute a fuel-cell chemical factory that produces electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen.\n",
      "Q. The California Air Resources Board just approved new regulations designed to put 500,000 zero-emission cars on the road by 2025. More than 160,000 of those vehicles would be hydrogen fuel-cell cars in one scenario. The regulations also require oil companies to build hydrogen refueling stations. Is this a big leap forward?\n",
      "A. I certainly hope so — it’s definitely a step along the way. The Japanese and Europeans (and especially the Germans) are setting up similar schemes supporting collaborations between carmakers and fuel providers to set up hydrogen stations. In those cases, there’s a lot of government money involved.\n",
      "Q. California would seem to be the epicenter of fuel-cell deployment in the United States, but even in Los Angeles today there are only a few public stations. Will there be a network in place by the time automakers roll out the first commercial fuel-cell cars in 2015?\n",
      "A. The California Fuel Cell Partnership is working hard to get more stations going. And the new CARB rules will also help.\n",
      "Q. The Clean Fuels Outlet provision of CARB’s rules will require oil companies to install hydrogen pumps at gas stations. The Western States Petroleum Association trade group has announced strong opposition and will possibly sue over it.\n",
      "A. The oil companies are being more cooperative with hydrogen fueling in Europe, so their actions may depend on how the political winds are blowing. If the oil companies are not in the forefront, there are other companies in the wings that are very active and want to provide hydrogen infrastructure. These include major industrial gas companies like Linde, Air Products and Air Liquide. Mercedes, for instance, is working with Linde to build 20 stations in Germany.\n",
      "Q. What’s been your experience behind the wheel of fuel-cell cars?\n",
      "A. I’ve driven quite a few, from G.M., Mercedes, Honda, Toyota, Mazda and Ford. I remember early Ford cars in the 1990s that lacked noise insulation and sounded like they had angry bees under their hoods. The cars have evolved considerably since then and are as fun to drive as anything else on the road. Automakers say they’re committed to fuel-cell production by 2015, and now they need to ensure that at least the beginnings of a hydrogen station network is built.\n",
      "Q. Will the cost of hydrogen come down?\n",
      "A. It will be competitive with gasoline eventually. At Stuttgart Airport in Germany, a station was selling it recently for $12 a kilogram. Since a kilo of hydrogen is the energy equivalent of a gallon of gas, and a fuel cell is twice as efficient as an internal-combustion engine, you could translate that into approximately $6 a gallon. That’s roughly what gasoline costs in Europe. Of course, hydrogen is probably subsidized at that price, but it indicates the potential for price reductions. The price will come down as more fuel providers get into the field, as production methods such as electrolysis and other forms evolve, and as storage and compression technology is made more efficient.\n",
      "Q. Will consumers accept fuel-cell cars?\n",
      "A. The people who have driven them are happy, but of course they tend to be hydrogen supporters.They say the cars are smooth and convenient to use, accelerate well and refuel very quickly, which is a big selling point. The one issue that disappoints people about battery electrics is range, and that’s not an issue for fuel-cell cars, which often travel 300 miles on a tank of hydrogen.\n",
      "Q. What about the safety issue? The Hindenburg disaster still looms large for many.\n",
      "A. From what I understand, these cars are as safe as they can be — as safe as gasoline cars. Even if hydrogen tanks leak, the gas just evaporates into the air, and there are extensive safety and warning devices built into the cars. In an accident, the hydrogen supply is cut off and valves automatically vent it in case of a pressure build-up. The concern will always be there, let’s face it, because hydrogen is very flammable. But the automakers tell me it won’t be an issue. I remember seeing a BMW film in the 1980s in which they dropped hydrogen tanks off a gantry, cooked them over a fire and tried to pierce them with a device. Nothing happened.\n",
      "Q. Any projections of how many fuel-cell cars might be on American roads by 2025?\n",
      "A. It’s hard to say, and I’m not a futurist or a prophet. I’ll cite the CARB estimate of 500,000 zero-emission cars by 2025, with maybe a third being fuel-cell vehicles.\n",

      "At least that’s what the dry statistics keep telling us. Industrial production, G.D.P. — the kind of figures that Washington and Wall Street sweat over — suggest that the economy is on the mend.\n",
      "Yet if we go beyond the Beltway and the Battery, to where most of American life is lived, the numbers don’t always add up. Yes, the Great Recession officially ended in 2009. But many millions of Americans are out of work or cannot find full-time jobs. Home prices are wobbly. The foreclosure crisis drags on. And the Occupy movement’s campaign against “the 1 percent” has underscored the ravages of income inequality.\n",
      "It was, as always, a year of ups and downs in business. Washington said the nation’s AAA rating was safe, but Standard & Poor’s concluded that it wasn’t. Europe insisted that its currency was sound, but investors worry that it isn’t. Wall Street seemed perpetually on edge. After so many wild days, the American stock market ended 2011 about where it began.\n",
      "On this side of the Atlantic, aftershocks of the financial crisis of 2008-9 are still reverberating, though the worst has passed. Now, how Europe’s economic troubles play out may determine whether job growth here finally picks up enough to make up for all the lost ground — and whether that 401(k) is richer or poorer next Jan. 1.\n",

Sunday Business asked the six economists who write the Economic View column to do a little blue-sky thinking on issues as varied as the Fed, Europe and housing. You won’t find stock tips. But if 2011 was any guide, the best advice for 2012 may be this: Hold tight.\n",
      "Dear Mr. Bernanke:\n",
      "Please Tell Us More\n",
      "N. GREGORY MANKIW A professor of economics at Harvard, he is advising Mitt Romney in the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.\n",
      "WHAT can we do to get this economy going?\n",
      "That’s the question Ben Bernanke and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve must be asking. Officially, the recession ended a while ago. But with unemployment lingering above 8 percent, it still feels as if we’re mired in a slump.\n",
      "The Fed’s typical response to lackluster growth is to reduce short-term interest rates. To its credit, it did that — quickly and drastically — as the recession unfolded in 2007 and 2008. Then it took various unconventional steps to push down long-term rates, including those on mortgages. Mr. Bernanke deserves more credit than anyone for preventing the financial crisis from turning into a second Great Depression.\n",
      "Now, the key will be managing expectations. Financial markets always look ahead, albeit imperfectly. They not only care what the Fed does today but also about what it will do tomorrow. With official short-term rates already near zero, what the Fed does this year will be less important than what policy makers say they will do next year — or the year after that.\n",
      "A crucial question is how quickly the Fed will raise interest rates as the economy recovers. So far, Fed policy makers have said they expect to keep rates “exceptionally low” at least until mid-2013. There has even been talk about extending that time frame by a year, to mid-2014.\n",
      "But Charles I. Plosser, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, was right when he said recently that “policy needs to be contingent on the economy, not the calendar.” The key to managing expectations will be spelling out this contingency plan in more detail. That is, what does the Fed need to see before it starts raising rates again?\n",
      "Unfortunately, economists don’t offer simple and unequivocal advice. Some suggest watching the overall inflation rate. Others say to watch inflation, but to exclude volatile food and energy prices. And still others advise targeting nominal gross domestic product, which weights inflation and economic growth equally.\n",
      "Forging a consensus among members of Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, won’t be easy. In fact, it may well be impossible. But the more clarity the Fed offers about its contingency plans, the better off we’ll all be in the years ahead.\n",
      "Two Big Problems,\n",
      "Two Ready Solutions\n",
      "CHRISTINA D. ROMER An economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, she was chairwoman of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers.\n",
      "THE United States faces two daunting economic problems: an unsustainable long-run budget deficit and persistent high unemployment. Both demand aggressive action in the form of fiscal policy.\n",
      "Waiting until after the November elections, as seems likely, would be irresponsible. It is also unnecessary, since there are plans to address both problems that should command bipartisan support.\n",
      "On the deficit, the big worry isn’t the current shortfall, which is projected to decline sharply as the economy recovers. Rather, it’s the long-run outlook. Over the next 20 to 30 years, rising health care costs and the retirement of the baby boomers are projected to cause deficits that make the current one look puny. At the rate we’re going, the United States would almost surely default on its debt one day. And like the costs of maintaining a home, the costs of dealing with our budget problems will only grow if we wait.\n",
      "We already have a blueprint for a bipartisan solution. The Bowles-Simpson Commission hashed out a sensible plan of spending cuts, entitlement program reforms and revenue increases that would shave $4 trillion off the deficit over the next decade. It shares the pain of needed deficit reduction, while protecting the most vulnerable and maintaining investments in our future productivity. Congress should take up the commission’s recommendation the first day it returns in January.\n",
      "But we can’t focus on the deficit alone. Persistent unemployment is destroying the lives and wasting the talents of more than 13 million Americans. Worse, the longer that people remain out of work, the more likely they are to suffer a permanent loss of skills and withdraw from the labor force.\n",

      "THERE are said to be at least 105 million and maybe as many as 2 billion parking spaces in the United States.\n",
      "A third of them are in parking lots, those asphalt deserts that we claim to hate but that proliferate for our convenience. One study says we’ve built eight parking spots for every car in the country. Houston is said to have 30 of them per resident. In “Rethinking a Lot,” a new study of parking, due out in March, Eran Ben-Joseph, a professor of urban planning at M.I.T., points out that “in some U.S. cities, parking lots cover more than a third of the land area, becoming the single most salient landscape feature of our built environment.”\n",
      "Absent hard numbers Mr. Ben-Joseph settles on a compromise of 500 million parking spaces in the country, occupying some 3,590 square miles, or an area larger than Delaware and Rhode Island combined. If the correct number is 2 billion, we’re talking about four times that: Connecticut and Vermont.\n",
      "Either way it’s a lot of pavement.\n",
      "As the critic Lewis Mumford wrote half a century ago, “The right to have access to every building in the city by private motorcar in an age when everyone possesses such a vehicle is the right to destroy the city.” Yet we continue to produce parking lots, in cities as well as in suburbs, in the same way we consume all those billions of plastic bottles of water and disposable diapers.\n",
      "What to do?\n",
      "For starters we ought to take these lots more seriously, architecturally. Many architects and urban planners don’t. Beyond greener designs and the occasional celebrity-architect garage, we need to think more about these lots as public spaces, as part of the infrastructure of our streets and sidewalks, places for various activities that may change and evolve, because not all good architecture is permanent. Hundreds of lots already are taken over by farmers’ markets, street-hockey games, teenage partiers and church services. We need to recognize and encourage diversity. This is the idea behind Parking Day, a global event, around since 2005, that invites anybody and everybody to transform metered lots. Each year participants have adapted hundreds of them in dozens of countries, setting up temporary health clinics and bike-repair shops, having seminars and weddings.\n",
      "That’s akin to the approach of an architecture and planning firm in Brooklyn called Interboro Partners. Several years ago it entered a competition in Los Angeles focused on dead shopping malls. Entrants picked malls they wanted to revive. Most contestants proposed erecting office parks or retirement homes or apartment buildings. Interboro took a different approach.\n",
      "It chose the Dutchess County Mall in Fishkill, N.Y. Opened with fanfare in spring 1974 as another consumer paradise and symbol of automotive and suburban progress, it was built on the promising corner of a major highway interchange in the heart of a county poised for growth. But development ended up gravitating elsewhere, and by the early 1990s the mall was half-empty; by 1998 it was officially closed. To drivers passing it on Interstate 84 it looked like every other dead mall, floating in the usual asphalt sea of parking spaces.\n",
      "But Interboro’s partners saw something else there: life.\n",
      "Of course suburban and urban lots are not all the same, and it’s glib to say we should just buy fewer cars. Yes, we ought to wean ourselves from automobiles in favor of public transportation. We rely too much on cars because our public transit systems are often so abysmal. But cars aren’t going away anytime soon, certainly not in the suburbs or in cities like Los Angeles, and we can’t just wish away lots in which to park them. John Brinckerhoff Jackson, the landscape writer who died in 1996, years ago pleaded that the parking lot be treated like the city common, with its own community values.\n",

The decision is the latest in a series of cautious reciprocal steps intended to reward sweeping political and economic changes in the country, also known as Burma. The restrictions on international financial organizations stem from American laws against human trafficking, which the United States State Department said Myanmar had taken “some steps to address.” The announcement came as an election commission in Myanmar affirmed that the country’s main opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, would be allowed to run in an election in April to fill 48 empty seats in Parliament.\n",

      "PROSECCO came down from the hills of Treviso after World War II, making a name for itself in the chic cafes of Venice, and later around the world, as a fresh, simple and appealing sparkling wine.\n",
      "But lately it’s become a lot less simple. Two years ago, a new area for prosecco production was created in the flat valley extending into the Friuli region, and this has encouraged winemakers in the original zone to set their wines apart from the new ones.\n",
      "In the new area, which encompasses nine provinces, most vineyards are large and their permitted yields high, and the vines can be mechanically harvested, all of which facilitates more-generic, lower-priced wine.\n",
      "Here in the original zone, amid the steep conical hills between the towns of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene in the province Treviso, most of the tiny plots carved out of the twisted earth centuries ago continue to be worked by hand by independent farmers. This area, now called prosecco superiore and designated a Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (D.O.C.G.), the highest level in Italian wine, is a complex mosaic of microclimates. Many winemakers are trying to showcase these distinctions, with noteworthy results.\n",
      "While most prosecco is nonvintage, enabling producers to blend wine from the previous year, more and more superiore wineries are making a millesimato, in which all the grapes must be from one vintage. Moreover, a new system called rive indicates vintage-dated proseccos made entirely of grapes from a single town or hamlet.\n",
      "“Every hillside — or rive, as we say in dialect — has a name, and each offers small particularities in pedoclimatic conditions,” said Franco Adami, winemaker and former president of the consortium of producers that is responsible for creating and administering the D.O.C.G. regulations. “The Rive Farra di Soligo is different from the Rive di San Martino, which is different from the Rive di Ogliano. This specialization of micro-zones, as exemplified by the rive system, was something I was committed to bringing to this region.”\n",
      "Many of the winemakers are specializing even further by producing a wine from a single vineyard. An excellent example is the Brut Prosecco Particella 68, made by Sorelle Bronca from a tiny parcel in the Rive di Colbertaldo. It has a subtle yeasty aroma of roasted peaches and dried flower petals, with a long, refreshingly acidic finish.\n",
      "Winemaking itself is changing in the region. Prosecco is generally made using Charmat (also known as the Italian method), whereby wine, following its primary fermentation in stainless steel, undergoes a second fermentation in large pressurized tanks called autoclaves to make it sparkling. This practice was developed in the late 1800s at the Scuola Enologica in Conegliano, Italy’s oldest wine school, and local producers have an almost paternal affection for it. But there is nothing that says prosecco must be made this way.\n",
      "A growing number of winemakers are experimenting with classic method refermentation in the bottle. Usually, sugar is added along with the yeast to induce the second fermentation, but some, like Bellenda in the S.C. 1931, are making a bottle-fermented pas dosè (without added sugar), creating a wine that is drier, yeastier and more complex than most proseccos.\n",
      "There is nothing that says a prosecco must be bubbly, either. Though uncommon, nonsparkling prosecco is an intriguing wine that retains the inimitable character of the glera grape, as the prosecco grape is now called, and the unique terroir it comes from. Adami, for example, makes a beautifully aromatic prosecco tranquillo in which the absence of bubbles seems to make the particularities of site and grape stand out even more.\n",
      "Prosecco is made predominantly from glera, but the regulations permit up to 15 percent of other approved grape varieties to be used. Cuvée del Fondatore by Valdo, one of the oldest wineries in the region, is made with 10 percent chardonnay matured in small oak barrels for six months, blended with 90 percent glera. The wine is then slowly refermented in autoclaves for one year, resulting in an unusually sophisticated prosecco that seems more mature than it is.\n",

The move was surprising, coming as tensions between the civilian government and the country’s powerful military have risen sharply and drawn in the judiciary.\n",
      "“President Zardari has gone to Dubai to attend the wedding of a son of a friend,” said Farhatullah Babar, Mr. Zardari’s spokesman. Mr. Babar identified the friend as Arif Zarooni, a man close to the rulers of Dubai, where Mr. Zardari maintains a residence. His last visit there, on Dec. 6 for medical treatment, set off speculation about his political future. Many were surprised by his return to Pakistan later in the month.\n",

The strains worsened sharply in October after an American businessman of Pakistani descent published a memo that he said was drafted by the government shortly after Bin Laden was killed and which appeared to solicit help from the United States in reining in the Pakistani military, smarting from the American raid.\n",

      "Carlos Henriquez stood front and center with his bass throughout “The Music of Cachao,” Jazz at Lincoln Center’s tribute to the pioneering Cuban bassist and composer Israel Cachao López on Friday night at the Rose Theater. This was, as Mr. Henriquez noted with a chuckle in the concert’s second half, a departure from his usual station near the back of the stage. But it made perfect sense: the tumbaos that boomed from Mr. Henriquez’s bass, in patterns more or less invented by Cachao, gave the music its flexible spine — along with a strong heartbeat, steady in its syncopations.\n",
      "Cachao, who died in 2008 at 89, was a traditionalist with the soul of an explorer, which helps explain how he adapted the courtly, elegant Cuban danzón to 20th-century usage and then laid much of the groundwork for mambo. “The Music of Cachao” presented this history for inspection without letting too much earnest pedagogy get in the way. The repertory, historical but vibrant, made its case even without the benefit of a dance floor.\n",
      "Mr. Henriquez, 32, served not only as the concert’s stand-in for Cachao — an imposing job, handled with commendable skill — but also as its musical director, bandleader-arranger and master of ceremonies. In other words he filled the multitasking role usually held by Wynton Marsalis. This wasn’t the first time he has been handed the keys to the Cadillac; he was an integral part of Jazz at Lincoln Center’s recent exchange with Cuba, for starters. But the stated focus of this tribute, and the absence of Mr. Marsalis, intensified his spotlight and amplified his achievement.\n",
      "He divided the concert into two segments, the first featuring a band stocked with Cachao alumni, including the tres player Nelson González, the flutist Gerardo Peña and the pianist Alfredo Valdés Jr. The percussion section was no less accomplished, with Charlie Santiago on timbales, Tony Rosa on congas and Anthony Carrillo on bongos and guiro. A string quartet brought the right balance of astringent sweetness to a couple of respectful danzóns, notably “El Estío” which elicited a soulful, piping flute solo from Mr. Peña.\n",
      "Another standout soloist, the trumpeter Michael Rodriguez, opened the concert with a fanfare, which led naturally into “Estudio en Trompeta,” with a call and response between vocals and horn. Mr. Rodriguez later played a gorgeously restrained duet with Mr. Henriquez, projecting brightly but softly, with a pristine and gallant sound.\n",
      "There was room for a more fiery trumpet showcase in the concert’s second half: “Escucha Dos Trompetas,” which hinged on a competitive back and forth between Mr. Rodriguez and Marcus Printup, a regular ace in the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. From here on out the orchestra augmented the first set’s personnel, playing Mr. Henriquez’s efficient big-band enlargements of Cachao tunes: “A Gozar Timbero,” rumbling and dramatic; “A Gozar con Mi Combo,” with just enough grit; and “Descarga Cubana,” featuring a lot of internal combustion among the horns.\n",
      "That last churning theme, synonymous with Cachao, ended the evening on a note of enlightened clamor. But not before a feverish solo by Mr. Henriquez: clawing at the strings of his bass, spiraling out of tempo and finally returning to the groove.\n",

      "His Cambodian name is Chenda Im, but after more than 30 years as a refugee in the United States, he goes by Mike, and he is the founder, owner, manager, cook and pitchman of Mike’s Burger House, which he opened on the lot of a gas station here after his return four years ago.\n",
      "“I’m American, and I already know how to handle burgers,” he said, as a salsa tune played in his restaurant. “The Cambodians, they eat the bun and then a little bit here and a little bit there. I say, ‘No, you just press down on the bun and eat it.’ And sometimes they say, ‘Don’t tell me how to eat. I’ll eat it my way.”’\n",

      "He is a truly hybrid Cambodian-American — a survivor of the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge period, when 1.7 million people died by execution, forced labor and starvation from 1975 to 1979; then a mail carrier for 22 years near Long Beach, California; and now one of a trickle of refugees who continue to return to restart life in the land they once fled.\n",
      "It is not a large number. Over the years some have returned to enter politics and some to try their hands at businesses. Many leave after a while. One group that does not have the option of returning to the United States is made up of Cambodian-born U.S. citizens who were convicted of felonies in their adopted country and sent back here under a special deportation law.\n",
      "Mike, who left at the age of 19 and is now 51, said he planned to stay. Among others who have returned and stayed are Ou Virak and Theary Seng, prominent advocates of a U.S. brand of human rights and civil society, which at this point fits a little awkwardly with Cambodia’s strong-arm form of government.\n",
      "Mike is a champion of the juicy all-beef hamburger, another import that is struggling to graft itself onto the local culture. There are no international hamburger chains in Cambodia, and Americans who live here say Mike makes the only truly American burgers in Phnom Penh.\n",
      "“Let me show them the way Americans eat,” Mike said, describing the training of his staff. “Show them it’s clean, safe, how to wash, really clean, from the bathroom to the kitchen. That’s the way Americans handle food. The more you keep clean, the healthier you are.”\n",
      "Mike’s Burger House has been open for about six months, and with its sign advertising “I’m a Crazy Burger!” it is an almost perfect replica of any hamburger hangout attached to a gas station in the United States.\n",
      "Its front counter displays packets of Americana: Pringles potato chips, Slim Jim meat snacks, Rip Rolls and Reese’s candy, Red Vine licorice, Ritz Crackers, Oreo cookies and Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies.\n",
      "Americans who live here say Mike’s offers a little taste of home. But for many Cambodians, hamburgers remain a challenge.\n",
      "“Sometimes the Cambodian people think I look down on them — ‘They don’t know how to eat’ — so I’ve got to step back and say, ‘O.K., you do it your way,”’ he said.\n",
      "Mike himself seems a little uncertain about his place between the two worlds. “I have a warm feeling here, just a warm feeling,” he said. “Everywhere I go, I feel like I’m at home.”\n",
      "But he also said, “My heart is still American,” and he speaks of his fellow Cambodians with some of the bafflement of an outsider.\n",
      "“On the street I don’t feel it’s hard to fit in,” he said. “The only difference is the way we talk in the United States. You say something straight, and they think you’re saying something bad.”\n",
      "But like Mike, all those of a certain age are children of the killing fields, when most lost relatives, and many continue to live with trauma.\n",

Kaplowitz, a psychologist in Manhattan who specializes in executive coaching, says employees generally don’t trust authority and find it hard to be honest about things like handling more work. “When we deal with authority, it’s an uneven game,” he says. Because people today are especially fearful about losing their jobs, they are reluctant to say no to their bosses.\n",
      "Q. What can you do instead of saying yes to a work request?\n",
      "A. At first, express gratitude that you’ve been asked to take on something new, because it means that your boss believes in you, says Tres Roeder, president of Roeder Consulting, a project management consultancy in Cleveland and author of “A Sixth Sense for Project Management.”\n",
      "If you think you may already have more work than you can handle, tell your boss that, because you’re juggling other time-sensitive projects, you need to examine the details of this new task to determine if there’s some way you can fit it in, Mr. Roeder says. You may find that you won’t be able to, but automatically responding “no” without any consideration gives the impression you just don’t want to deal with it, he says. “And you don’t want to be known as the person who always says no unless they get the perfect assignment,” he adds.\n",
      "If the work needs to be done immediately, tell your boss what you’re already working on and then let him or her do the prioritizing, says Evelyn Williams, a professor at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., who teaches organizational behavior. “Ask what you should do first. Should you stop working on X and Y and finish this new project first?” Framing it this way creates the feeling of a partnership between you and your boss, rather than putting you in a subservient role, she says.\n",
      "Another option is to act as a quarterback, bringing in others who might be able to help. For example, Mr. Roeder says, the new project may require a lot of financial data, so you could say, “Let’s get someone from finance to help with that data, and I will see to it the rest of the work is completed.”\n",
      "Q. By agreeing to take on extra work, you’re creating a crisis because you can’t get everything done on time. Is there some way out that won’t reflect badly on you?\n",
      "A. Start by estimating how long the project will take — then decide whether there is any way to fit it into your week. Think about quick ways to achieve milestones in the project and what kind of deadline is realistic, then take that information to your boss, Professor Williams says. Simply telling your boss that you are overwhelmed and can’t get the work done could make you seem less competent, she says.\n",
      "If there is no way for you to do any of the work in the allotted time, take responsibility by saying you accepted the assignment without having thought things through, says Mr. Camp, author of a book on negotiating called “Start With No.”\n",
      "“Let your manager know that in hindsight, you realize you should have asked him what was most important, so you are doing that now,” he says.\n",
      "Q. Is it ever a good idea to try to squeeze in the extra work, even if you’re already feeling stretched?\n",
      "A. If the project could improve your skills or get you noticed by those who can promote your career, it may be worth losing sleep over, Professor Williams says. “Think about it strategically,” she says. “Will the task or project be a good thing for your career? Will it build your network?”\n",
      "Your manager may be handing you this new project with the intention of pushing your limits — to improve your professional capabilities, Mr. Roeder says. If that seems to be the case, try to fit it in.\n",
      "Q. What can you do in the future to help manage your work commitments?\n",
      "A. Give short, weekly status updates about your workload to your manager, Professor Williams says. “Managers can’t see into every employee’s world,” she says. “You have to tell them what’s happening in the trenches so they can make better allocation decisions.”\n",

      "Offstage the much publicized story of the Shanghai dancer and choreographer Jin Xing, is one of courage, controversy, unorthodoxy. Onstage her “Shanghai Tango” program, playing at the Joyce Theater this week, is thoroughly and harmlessly conventional. The performance ends affirmatively with bright colors and bright energy to 19th-century Viennese waltz music: cue applause. And yet the experience becomes a sad one. Why has a life so extraordinary been channeled into art so conformist?\n",
      "Jin Xing, born male in China in 1967 to parents of Korean descent, joined the People’s Liberation Army at age 9 and rose to the rank of colonel, studied dance in the Chinese city Shenyang and in New York, and was an award-winning performer internationally before choosing to undergo sex-change surgery in the mid-1990s. After initial government opposition to her affiliation to modern dance, she is today considered a “cultural leader” in Shanghai, married with three adopted children, has published a memoir and was the subject of a 2001 French documentary, “Colonel Jin Xing.”\n",
      "Nothing in “Shanghai Tango” (2000) is as interesting as those biographical facts. The choreography looks government approved, tourist friendly, ingratiatingly orthodox. The program says that the 10 items form an overview of Ms. Jin’s work over 25 years. Despite the changes that those 25 years brought China and Ms. Jin, they add up to a remarkably consistent picture of politely agreeable West-absorbs-East idioms. The music ranges from Johann Strauss II (the “Blue Danube” waltz) and Astor Piazzolla to John Williams (the theme from “Schindler’s List”) and Rene Aubry; the most advanced item sounds like Philip Glass lite. The sound and look are less Asian than Orientalist.\n",
      "Until the closing waltz the music is almost all in 2/4 or 4/4 tempo and tango-friendly, though no tango is actually danced. The choreography’s dullest feature is its dependence on the downbeat: the strong gesture of each dance phrase always arrives, predictably, on a strong musical beat, with none of the witty rhythmic suspense or brilliance that characterizes tango.\n",
      "It’s reasonable under the circumstances to be particularly curious about what “Shanghai Tango,” performed by 14 dancers including Ms. Jin, has to say about masculinity and femininity. Here too, however, the choreography plays safe. The one same-sex duet (male-male) is entirely sexless and mildly acrobatic along the lines of Pilobolus. Another duet, for a man and a woman dressed identically, shows mutual supportiveness and tender affection: the man does the lifting, and the woman shows her gratitude. In general the view of women here — not least when Ms. Jin herself dances in “Half Dream” — is that they wear prettier frocks and show their emotions more easily; and women’s emotions range from joy to suffering. Men, however, are occasionally unkind.\n",
      "The title number, inspired by a Chinese folk tale, is about a mother who is conflicted between her husband and lover. Well, that’s what the program told me afterward. From the dance itself, which made the story like a soap opera, I assumed that she and her eldest son were sexually drawn to each other, while also taking turns to be extremely attached to a mobile stool, on which she or he now and then zoomed around the stage. Anyway, the heroine grieved guiltily until, on the last beat, she fell dead in her husband’s arms. I am sorry to report that I forget what happened to the stool.\n",

      "RASHID JOHNSON was discussing his coming exhibition at the Hauser & Wirth gallery recently, when Marc Payot, a gallery partner, mentioned that a previous owner of the gallery’s sleek town house on East 69th Street in Manhattan was the boxing promoter Don King .\n",
      "Mr. Johnson, a longtime boxing fan whose father had been a Golden Gloves fighter, said he froze. “I was like, ‘Don King used to live in this house?’ ”\n",
      "As a child, Mr. Johnson said, he watched Mr. King on television as he used his catch phrase, “Only in America,” and waved American flags. “I’d never seen black people representing themselves as so patriotic,” Mr. Johnson said during an interview last month, adding that at the time he assumed Mr. King was sincere.\n",
      "Now, Mr. Johnson said, he wonders. Was such patriotic pageantry a tool of self-interest? Or was there an element of truth in it? How do public figures like Mr. King confront their times, and what can be learned from them?\n",
      "These questions became a platform for Mr. Johnson’s first solo show with Hauser & Wirth, “Rumble,” named after the Rumble in the Jungle, fought in the former Zaire in 1974 between the world heavyweight champion George Foreman and Muhammad Ali — and which was promoted by Mr. King. (“Rumble,” featuring new wall sculptures and a film, opens Wednesday.)\n",
      "For more than a decade Mr. Johnson’s photographs, sculptural installations and films have drawn inspiration from larger-than-life figures like Mr. King who challenge conventional models of behavior. Images of Frederick Douglass, the jazz composer Sun Ra, the writer and activist W. E. B. Dubois and the heavyweight boxer Jack Johnson are among those fused into larger works made up of burnt wood, mirror glass and a mixture of black soap and wax that Mr. Johnson calls “cosmic slop,” after the venerable song by Funkadelic.\n",
      "Mr. Johnson’s bold markings and symbols recall the work of Franz Kline and Adolph Gottlieb. His deep engagement with materials and form suggest artists as diverse as Joseph Beuys and Carl Andre. But it’s his disarming fusion of contradictory elements — jarring references to cross hairs and branding offset by offerings of shea butter and gridlike compositions of hand-cut mirror tiles, brainy seriousness balanced by self-mocking humor — that has created excitement.\n",
      "He is one of six finalists for the 2012 Hugo Boss Prize, which is given every two years and recognizes significant achievement in contemporary art. (The winner, to be announced next fall, gets $100,000 cash and a solo show at the Guggenheim in New York.)\n",
      "In April “Rashid Johnson: Message to Our Folks,” a survey of some 40 photographs, prints, sculptures, installations, wall pieces and a film, is scheduled to open at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. In September a solo show of new works is scheduled for the David Kordansky Gallery in Los Angeles. And in October the South London Gallery, a contemporary-art museum and performance space, will present a solo exhibition of his work during the Frieze Art Fair.\n",
      "“Rashid recognizes that history is more than what happened yesterday,” Matthew Day Jackson, an artist and sometime collaborator who also shows at Hauser & Wirth, said by phone. “His particular use of mirrors, animal skin, black soap or CB radios speaks of his own history, art history, but also history in the broadest sense.”\n",
      "Julie Rodrigues Widholm, an associate curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago who’s organizing Mr. Johnson’s exhibition in April, said, “Rashid creates objects for conversation.” By making photographs that look like paintings, paintings that are somehow sculptural, sculptures that resemble furniture, she said, “he’s inviting viewers to ask: ‘What do I do when I encounter something unfamiliar? Do I move on quickly? Do I linger? Do I go home and do research? Do I look everything up online?’ ”\n",
      "For Mr. Johnson, born in 1977 and raised in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, the show is a homecoming. As his mother earned a doctorate in African history from Northwestern University, Mr. Johnson said, he would often wander into her library to look at books about African-American history and culture. His wall pieces that resemble shelving units, he said, “are in some ways mimicking that experience.”\n",
      "After his parents divorced, Mr. Johnson spent weekends in the Chicago neighborhood of Wicker Park, where his father ran a small electronics company, installing devices like CB radios in cars and homes. At a baby sitter’s house, Mr. Johnson said, a main source of entertainment was a police scanner; his baby sitter and her friends would all sit around it and then comment on what was going on in the neighborhood.\n",
      "Placing radios in shelving units, he said, is “a kind of marriage of materials from my mother’s and father’s houses after they were divorced.” These memories recur in his work, along with his enthusiasm for hip-hop, movies like “Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song” and “Watermelon Man” by Melvin Van Peebles and, of course, boxing.\n",
      "Mr. Johnson earned a B.F.A. in photography in 2000 from Columbia College in Chicago, where he studied with the portraitist Dawoud Bey. At the Art Institute of Chicago, he said, “I took as many courses as I could” with the social activist and artist Gregg Bordowitz. An early break came in 2001, when Mr. Johnson was included in “Freestyle,” a high-profile roundup of contemporary black artists organized by Thelma Golden at the Studio Museum in Harlem.\n",
      "During a visit to Mr. Johnson’s current mini-factory in Bushwick, Brooklyn, the atmosphere was convivial. A hip-hop mixtape playing Busta Rhymes was drowned out by the recurring whir of a table saw. The floors and tables were cluttered with works in progress. The large-scale piece inspired by Mr. King hung on a wall.\n",
      "Mr. Johnson, tall and fit in a mustard-colored velour hoodie, called it “a fairly anxious work, with a lot of broken bits of mirror.” Clumps of cosmic slop looked like dripping black snowballs on its cracked surface. At its center, the word “Rumble.”\n",
      "Mr. Johnson recalled going with his father to watch the 1988 world heavyweight championship fight between Mike Tyson and Michael Spinks on an enormous television screen at Chicago Stadium. The fight, promoted by Mr. King, lasted 91 seconds. “It was the most aggressive knockout dominance I’d ever seen,” Mr. Johnson said.\n",
      "He clearly loves a good fight. Yet his ode to Mr. King will appear alongside a film called “The New Black Yoga,” a funny riff on learning yoga in a foreign country. In addition, blackened-steel shelves will hold a working CB radio. A charred piece of red-oak floor will be balanced by a sculpture that has a balm for healing burns.\n",
      "Who knows? Viewers may end up feeling as Ms. Widholm did. She said: “Rashid’s work derives from his personal experiences, but it’s about shared connections. He doesn’t lose the specifics of his story, while making work that feels universal.”\n",

      "Charla Krupp, who gained a national following by offering women advice on looking younger and thinner with best-selling books like “How Not to Look Old,” died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 58, but looked a perennial 49.\n",
      "The cause was breast cancer, her husband, Richard Zoglin, said.\n",
      "In her books and in more than 100 appearances on the “Today” program on NBC, Ms. Krupp offered down-to-earth style tips intended for real women, not red-carpet icons. Her “five things that will make you thinner by dinner,” for example, included a properly fitted brassiere. Women were advised to trade in their “O.L.” (Old Lady) granny glasses for sexier frames and to retire their relaxed “mommy jeans” in favor of more svelte styles.\n",
      "“How Not to Look Old,” published in 2008, spent 15 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, rising to No. 2 in the advice and how-to category. It sold more than 300,000 copies, according to the book’s publisher, Grand Central Publishing.\n",
      "At a moment when many women of a certain age in the United States were debating whether to Botox or not to Botox, the book provided nonsurgical suggestions on how to avoid the appearance of senescence, often delivered as capital-lettered pronouncements like: “NOTHING AGES YOU LIKE ... YELLOW TEETH.”\n",
      "The book became a style manual intended for women of all stripes, whether they were sales clerks, homemakers, college professors or venture capitalists. “My book is hitting a nerve because I am giving not looking old a spin as if your life depended on it,” Ms. Krupp said in an interview with The Times in 2008.\n",
      "But the book’s central tenet — that the best way for a woman to counteract ageism is to make a Herculean effort to disguise her age — also invited controversy. Some critics likened the premise to encouraging people to fight prejudice by hiding their ethnicity.\n",
      "Ms. Krupp argued, however, that in an era of ubiquitous cellphone cameras, Facebook photo albums and workplace downsizing, camouflaging one’s age was a professional necessity for women.\n",
      "“For our generation, looking younger isn’t just about vanity,” Ms. Krupp wrote. “Looking good is about our personal and financial survival.”\n",
      "Charla Miriam Krupp was born on Jan. 29, 1953, in Chicago, the eldest of three children. She grew up in Wilmette, Ill., a Chicago suburb. Her father, Walter Krupp, worked in the clothing business. Her mother, Esther Krupp, is a real estate broker.\n",
      "Interested in journalism at an early age, Ms. Krupp was editor in chief of the school newspaper at New Trier West High School. She graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a bachelor’s degree in journalism in 1975. After college, she was a summer editorial intern at Mademoiselle magazine in New York City and remained in New York to pursue journalism.\n",
      "Ms. Krupp began investigating the relationship between a woman’s attractiveness and her career trajectory early in her own career. At Glamour magazine, where she was entertainment editor from 1980 to 1995, she wrote articles about ageism and salary disparities in Hollywood. One article questioned why Julia Roberts earned less than Sylvester Stallone. Ms. Krupp also introduced “Women of the Year” awards in Glamour’s entertainment pages.\n",
      "Ms. Krupp went on to work as a senior editor and television commentator for InStyle magazine; as a beauty director at Glamour; a columnist for More magazine; and a contributing editor at People StyleWatch.\n",
      "In addition to her mother and her husband, Time magazine’s theater critic, Ms. Krupp is survived by a sister, Lora Nasby, and a brother, Jay.\n",
      "Ms. Krupp’s second personal grooming book, “How to Never Look Fat Again,” was published in 2010 and spent four weeks on the Times best-seller list. Like her first advice book, it told women in humorous but blunt terms what to do — and, more important, what not to do — to appear more attractive.\n",
      "Using before-and-after photos titled “High Fat” and “No Fat,” the book offered stark illustrations of how a simple change of neckline, hemline, undergarment or accessory could instantly streamline a woman’s look.\n",
      "“When you are wearing a choker or any short necklace, you are in effect taking a yellow highlighter and drawing a circle around the circumference of your neck,” Ms. Krupp wrote. “Who needs that?”\n",

      "There are a couple of movies, or rather a couple of story ideas, tucked in “Loosies,” an amorphous, laugh-flecked drama about a New York City pickpocket that mostly comes across as a feature-length advertisement for its likable star and writer, Peter Facinelli. A pretty man with an easy grin, Mr. Facinelli has a leading man’s looks if not the presence or credits, and is best known these days for standing around stiffly as Dr. Carlisle Cullen, the forever young paterfamilias of the vampire brood in the “Twilight” flicks. He was infinitely better in the 2007 season of the cable show “Damages,” where he was actually given a character to work with, one whose appeal was tinged with menace.\n",
      "There’s little shading to Bobby, alas, who zips around Manhattan lifting wallets, cellphones and watches. Bobby comes with a bit of mystery, though mostly just a back story that emerges between some domestic-comedy buffoonery with his mother, Rita (Marianne Leone), and far too much romantic-comedy busyness with Lucy (Jaimie Alexander), a one-night stand turned major subplot. When Bobby is with his mother in their humble apartment, swatting at a mouse with a broom or taking a punch from his mother’s squeeze (Joe Pantoliano), he seems to be in a movie about a working-class regular guy trying to get by. When he’s with Lucy, it’s as if that movie had been interrupted by a commercial for eHarmony, complete with a montage sequence (long walks, handholding, sunrise).\n",
      "The director, Michael Corrente, whose films include “Federal Hill” and “Brooklyn Rules,” is most comfortable nosing around the edges of this one, particularly in scenes featuring the fine supporting cast. Somewhere along the way, Bobby swipes a badge belonging to Lt. Nick Sullivan (Michael Madsen), a hothead (what else?) with an amiably forgiving boss, Capt. Tom Edwards (William Forsythe). Sullivan wants his badge back, which is how he ends up chasing after Bobby. Mr. Madsen and Mr. Forsythe, who hang on each other like a couple of battle-fatigued old boxers — in their best moment their characters just throw back a couple of drinks at a bar — are in a tonally different, shaggier, more enjoyable movie than Mr. Facinelli and Ms. Alexander.\n",
      "Vincent Gallo, meanwhile, is somewhere else, though it can be hard to know precisely where that is. He plays Jax, Bobby’s mercurial, ill-tempered employer and sometime confessor, a kind of Fagin in red bathrobe and slippers. A low-level gangster, Jax operates out of an atmospheric dump crammed with boosted goods and occupied by a silent, much younger companion, Donny (Eric Phillips). Jax has a history with Bobby that’s explained, if vaguely, in one of the movie’s various flashbacks. When Bobby appears in that dusty, cramped room with Jax, you see a hint of what “Loosies” could have been, a tough little number where the edges were left ragged, the smiles died instead of bloomed, and the love interest was a woman rather than a girl who’s more Katherine Heigl than real.\n",

      "MANCHESTER, N.H. — Mitt Romney has now defied a generation of political gravity, doing what no non-incumbent Republican has done since the Iowa caucuses became a key part of the campaign in the 1970s, winning the one-two states of Iowa and New Hampshire in his quest for the party’s presidential nomination.\n",
      "But on Wednesday, Mr. Romney’s plane will deliver him to the tougher proving ground of South Carolina for a crucial test.\n",
      "It will be there — a place famous for surfacing the dark undercurrents of American politics — that he has the opportunity to show he can overcome doubts among evangelicals and Tea Party adherents about his ideological commitment and assume leadership of a party that has spent the last two years under the sway of a conservative insurgency.\n",
      "If he succeeds, it will be a triumph of political rebranding, a long effort by Mr. Romney to leave behind a past that includes former support for abortion rights and authorship of a health care plan that helped inspire President Obama’s.\n",
      "A Republican Party whose more energetic precincts have been gripped throughout the Obama presidency by a desire to expel moderates and upend the establishment will have put itself in the hands of a candidate who, more than anyone in the race, comes out of a moderate, establishment Republican tradition.\n",
      "But to get there — or get there without a protracted battle — he will have to fend off efforts by his rivals in South Carolina to emerge as the singular anti-Romney candidate.\n",
      "With little left to lose, Newt Gingrich and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas are already assailing him as a heartless job killer in South Carolina, a state hit far harder by the economic downturn than Iowa and New Hampshire were.\n",
      "But just fending off that attack may not be enough. He is also heading smack into an issue that has followed him through his national political career: his Mormon faith and the suspicion many evangelical Christians have of it.\n",
      "“It’s going to be difficult for Romney as a Mormon with the evangelical community,” said the Rev. Franklin Graham, son of the Rev. Billy Graham. “For most Christians, Mormonism is an issue and he has a hurdle here that he’s going to have to jump over and navigate around if he can.”\n",
      "But the barely hidden glee of the Romney campaign when Mr. Perry decided to stay in the race after performing badly in Iowa, to fight another day in South Carolina, betrayed another lucky factor that has helped give the Romney team confidence in the state: In the absence of a successful effort by any of his rivals to rally evangelical voters behind just one of them, the cast of candidates vying for the anti-Romney religious vote is promising to carve it up into smaller pieces.\n",
      "Mr. Perry made a point of appealing to evangelical voters with a giant prayer rally in Texas shortly before he announced his presidential campaign and has shown crosses in his advertisements; Mr. Gingrich, who is on his third marriage and third religion, has visited with pastors to assure them of his new but deep Roman Catholicism and his apologies to God. And now Rick Santorum is planning to campaign hard in the northern part of South Carolina because “that’s where much of the evangelical vote is,” said former Representative J. Gresham Barrett of South Carolina, a supporter and adviser.\n",
      "So it is with acute interest that Mr. Romney’s aides are keeping their eye on a meeting of major evangelical leaders to be held this week in Texas, where there has been some talk of a move to coalesce around a single conservative alternative to Mr. Romney.\n",
      "Gary L. Bauer, president of American Values and one of the organizers, said Tuesday in an interview, “We’re not forming some alliance to stop somebody else that’s competing for the nomination,” adding, “the only person in that room the people want to stop is Barack Obama from having a second term.”\n",
      "Mr. Bauer, it happens, will be supporting Mr. Santorum, whom he endorsed and campaigned with last week. But Mr. Bauer said the meeting would include advocates “for all of the candidates, including Romney.” Mr. Romney’s advocates are expected to be working the room aggressively.\n",

      "THE polarized rhetoric of the 2012 election cycle presents voters with a false choice of whether the government can create jobs or should just get out of the way. The real debate should be about which policies work and which don’t.\n",
      "I spent three years reporting on the $840 billion stimulus plan that the Obama administration pushed through Congress in 2009. My conclusion: government can create jobs — it just doesn’t often do it well.\n",
      "The stimulus — a historic package of tax cuts, safety-net spending, infrastructure projects and green-energy investments — certainly did a lot of good. As the economists Alan S. Blinder and Mark Zandi have noted, it’s one of the key reasons the unemployment rate isn’t in double digits now.\n",
      "But the stimulus ultimately failed to bring about a strong, sustainable recovery. Money was spread far and wide rather than dedicated to programs with the most bang for the buck. “Shovel-ready” projects, those that would put people to work right away, took too long to break ground. Investments in worthwhile long-term projects, on the other hand, were often rushed to meet arbitrary deadlines, and the resulting shoddy outcomes tarnished the projects’ image.\n",
      "After trumpeting shovel-ready projects as the bedrock of his stimulus plan, President Obama admitted famously that “there’s no such thing.” But there were, and are, shovel-ready projects. The administration just needed to find them. Case in point: the nuclear cleanup at the Savannah River Site in Aiken, S.C., which received $1.6 billion in stimulus money. As soon as the money arrived in the summer of 2009, the retired cold war nuclear plant hired thousands of workers to decommission reactors, install pumps in the liquid waste tanks and ship barrels of solid waste to a salt formation in the Chihuahuan Desert. Workers from out of town filled up nearly all of the area’s apartments, hotels and restaurants. The county’s unemployment dropped to 8.5 percent from 10.2 percent in a matter of months.\n",
      "Why did it work? Because the government could immediately send billions of dollars to contractors who were already in place for a project that had well-established plans.\n",
      "The problem with most of the projects was that the Obama administration and Congress had defined “shovel ready” too broadly. The original plan called for putting “shovels in the ground” within 90 days. But when the rules were written, states ended up with 120 days to have their road projects “approved.” It often took six more months to a year before most of the projects were under construction.\n",
      "Weatherization, for example, was billed as the low-hanging fruit of the clean-energy movement. But states are still sitting on roughly a billion dollars in unused grant money because of a tortured bureaucracy, in which the federal government paid the states, which paid local nonprofits, which then hired the contractors.\n",
      "Neither states nor nonprofit groups were prepared to handle 20 to 30 times more money than usual. And federal officials brought ready projects to a standstill in the first year by applying new rules regarding prevailing wages.\n",
      "As a result, the stimulus didn’t provide enough oomph in the first year to overcome the effects of the European debt crisis and rising gas prices in 2010.\n",
      "The stimulus effort should have contained more programs like Cash for Clunkers, which pulled car sales forward, emptied dealership lots and prompted auto plants to bring back thousands of employees.\n",
      "“We’re trying to figure out, ‘Man, how did that thing just blow up the way it did?’ ” President Obama later said. “Essentially, all the auto companies did the marketing. They did the advertising in a way the government just can’t do it and, frankly, even if we did it, people wouldn’t listen.”\n",
      "The stimulus also could have been more powerful if the administration had pursued a temporary jobs program similar to the Works Progress Administration, which directly employed eight million people during the Depression.\n",
      "As it was, states could create temporary jobs programs through a $5 billion emergency welfare fund. Not enough states took advantage of it, but those that did saw real results. Fresno County, Calif., where unemployment was 18 percent, found jobs for 2,000 people who were out of work or underemployed.\n",

      "On a cold day last winter, an ailing Bernard Greenhouse, wearing an elegant bathrobe and attached to oxygen, was wheeled into the living room of his Cape Cod home, which was festooned with paper cutouts of musical notes. Relatives and students, locals and caregivers had gathered to celebrate the 95th birthday of one of classical music’s most respected cellists, a founding member of the famed Beaux Arts Trio and a beloved teacher. Young cellists performed for him, and then Greenhouse indulged in a martini and a plate of oysters. Thus fortified, he decided he wanted to play for the company. He picked up his cello and, though a bit wobbly, soulfully rendered “Song of the Birds,” a Catalan folk melody transcribed by Pablo Casals, with whom he studied many years ago.\n",
      "“And then he laid down the bow and praised the cello for its beauty,” Nicholas Delbanco, Greenhouse’s son-in-law, recounted. “He said it had been his lifelong companion and the darling of his heart.” Indeed, the instrument, known as the Countess of Stainlein, ex-Paganini of 1707 — perhaps the greatest surviving Stradivarius cello — had been with Greenhouse for 54 years. It was his voice on numerous recordings and a presence at up to 200 concerts a year. Toward the end of his life, Greenhouse asked his nurses to lay the instrument next to him in bed.\n",
      "But in a twist of exquisite poignancy, Greenhouse was not actually playing his precious cello that day on Cape Cod. It was an exact replica that was made especially for him, a beautiful instrument but not the Strad. As they listened to him talk of his love for the cello, his daughter Elena Delbanco and her husband grieved that he could not tell he was playing the substitute. “We knew that this was the beginning of the end,” Nicholas Delbanco said. Five months later, Greenhouse died.\n",
      "Despite saying that he wanted to sell his cello while he was still alive so that a worthy young musician might benefit from it, Greenhouse was unable to part with it. Now his family has entrusted the sale of the Countess of Stainlein to the Boston violin dealer Christopher Reuning, who this week will open sealed bids starting in the millions of dollars.\n",
      "Much attention in the music world is given to the sale of Strads and other rare string instruments. The numbers are tallied up like baseball records: $15.9 million for the 1721 Lady Blunt Stradivarius violin this year; more than $10 million for the Kochanski Guarneri del Gesu in 2009. Reuning expects that the Greenhouse cello will match or exceed the previous record of $6 million for a cello. Behind the dollar figures, though, is a story of possession and loss, of performers giving up the instruments that have defined their artistic and emotional selves.\n",
      "“It was the pride of his life,” Elena Delbanco, a lecturer at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, said of her father’s Strad. “It was his soul mate. Until the day he died he could not bear to part with it.\n",
      "“I would like him, were he around, to think that we did the right thing and be happy where the cello went,” she continued. “I would like it to be loved as much by its next owner as it was by my father.”\n",
      "The master makers of bowed instruments flourished in northern Italy from about 1550 to 1750, when supreme craftsmanship, superior woods and varnish, enduring models and a highly developed apprentice system centered on a few families. The best-known were located in Cremona and included Amati, Guarneri and Bergonzi. But the greatest acclaim has belonged to Antonio Stradivari, or Stradivarius, as he was also known. Only about 600 instruments attributed to him are still in existence, including 20 of his prime cellos — made after 1707 in a slightly smaller size, called Forma B, and more adapted to solo playing. The Countess of Stainlein is the earliest known Forma B.\n",

      "The difficulty and uncertainty in predicting natural gas resources was underscored last week when the Energy Information Administration released a report containing sharply lower estimates.\n",
      "The agency estimated that there are 482 trillion cubic feet of shale gas in the United States, down from the 2011 estimate of 827 trillion cubic feet — a drop of more than 40 percent. The report also said the Marcellus region, a rock formation under parts of New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, contained 141 trillion cubic feet of gas. That represents a 66 percent drop from the 410 trillion cubic feet estimate offered in the agency’s last report.\n",
      "The Energy Information Administration said the sharp downward revisions to its estimates were informed by more data. “Drilling in the Marcellus accelerated rapidly in 2010 and 2011, so that there is far more information available today than a year ago,” its report said. Jonathan Cogan, a spokesman for the agency, added that Pennsylvania had made far more data available than in previous years.\n",
      "Under the agency’s new estimates, the Marcellus shale, which was previously thought to hold enough gas to meet the entire nation’s demand for 17 years at current consumption rates, contains instead a six-year supply. The report comes just five months after the United States Geological Survey released its own estimate of 84 trillion cubic feet for the Marcellus shale.\n",
      "The estimates are important because they underpin policy decisions on energy subsidies and exports. Market analysts look to these estimates in making investment decisions. Historically, they have varied widely based on assumptions about the future of technology, coming regulations on drilling and the long-term price of gas.\n",
      "Previously inaccessible, shale gas has been unlocked in recent years by advances in a drilling technology known as hydraulic fracturing, or hydrofracking. These advances have prompted a drilling frenzy in states like Louisiana, Pennsylvania and Texas, which has helped create tens of thousands of jobs, lowered energy prices for consumers and offered the promise of lessening American dependence on foreign energy.\n",
      "Despite the lower estimates, the agency’s report noted that shale gas would continue to have a growing impact on the broader energy market. The share of natural gas produced by drilling in shale formations is projected to more than double, from 23 percent in 2010 to 49 percent in 2035, the report said. The United States will also become a net exporter of liquefied natural gas by 2016, while natural gas prices are expected to remain low for more than a decade, according to the report.\n",
      "Energy companies are also likely to be undaunted by the new lower estimates because they are confident that whatever the total amount of available gas, technology will improve over time so that they can access the gas more efficiently and profitably. This assumption depends on the price of gas rising soon from the rock-bottom levels where it has lingered since late 2008.\n",
      "In his State of the Union address last week, President Obama said the United States had a nearly 100-year supply of natural gas.\n",
      "That prediction includes gas from shale wells, offshore wells and Alaska’s North Slope. But many energy experts question these types of projections because they include substantial amounts of natural gas that many scientists and engineers say may never be tapped.\n",
      "Drilling proponents, including investors and many politicians, tend to embrace optimistic projections, even though estimating resources is an inexact science.\n",
      "Some of the earliest and most optimistic estimates of gas resources have come from academia. In 2009, Terry Engelder, a geosciences professor at Pennsylvania State University, helped accelerate the rush to drill for natural gas in Pennsylvania and surrounding states by projecting that more than 500 trillion cubic feet of natural gas could be produced from the Marcellus.\n",

      "JOAN OF ARC was born 600 years ago. Six centuries is a long time to continue to mark the birth of a girl who, according to her family and friends, knew little more than spinning and watching over her father’s flocks. But type her name into Amazon’s search engine and you get more than 6,000 results. France’s national archives include tens of thousands of volumes about her. She has been immortalized by Shakespeare, Voltaire, Twain, Shaw, Brecht, Verdi, Tchaikovsky and Rubens; more recently, her life was fodder for the CBS television series “Joan of Arcadia.”\n",
      "What is it about Joan of Arc? Why is her story of enduring interest more than a half a millennium after her birth?\n",
      "By the time Joan of Arc was 16 and had proclaimed herself the virgin warrior sent by God to deliver France from her enemies, the English, she had been receiving the counsel of angels for three years. Until then, the voices she said she heard, speaking from over her right shoulder and accompanied by a great light, had been hers alone, a rapturous secret.\n",
      "But in 1428, when the voices pressed her to undertake the quest for which they had been preparing her, they transformed a seemingly undistinguished peasant into a visionary heroine who defied every limitation placed on a woman of the late Middle Ages. The least likely of military leaders, Joan of Arc changed the course of the Hundred Years’ War and of history.\n",
      "Joan said she sheared off her hair, dressed in male attire, put on armor and took up her sword at God’s behest. She was feverish in her determination to succeed at what was, by anyone’s measure, a preposterous mission. As Joan herself protested to her voices, she “knew not how to ride or lead in war”; and yet she roused an exhausted, underequipped and impotent army into a fervor that carried it from one unlikely victory to the next. She raised the siege of Orléans by defying the cautious strategies of seasoned generals to follow inaudible directions from invisible beings.\n",
      "Illiterate and uncouth, Joan moved purposefully among nobles, bishops and royalty. So intent on vanquishing the enemy that she threatened her own men with violence, she herself recoiled at the idea of bloodshed. To avoid having to use her sword, she led her army carrying a 12-foot-long banner emblazoned with the words Party of the Kingdom of Heaven. Witnesses said she was luminous in battle, light not glinting off her armor so much as radiating from the girl within. Her enemies spoke of clouds of butterflies following in her wake, a curiously beatific report from men who said she was in league with the devil.\n",
      "In the aftermath of combat she didn’t celebrate victory but mourned the casualties; her men remembered her on her knees weeping as she held the head of a dying enemy soldier, urging him to confess his sins. Her courage outstripped that of seasoned men at arms; her tears flowed as readily as any other teenage girl’s.\n",
      "After a series of victories, Joan suffered the reversals her voices had predicted. Captured and sold to the English, and shackled in a dank cell for more than a year, Joan was put on trial for her life. For refusing to renounce the voices that guided her as deviltry, Joan, 19 years old, was burned at the stake before a jeering crowd, her charred body displayed to anyone who cared to examine it. Thirty years later, in 1450, a Rehabilitation Trial overturned the guilty verdict that condemned her to death; the 19th-century rediscovery of the transcripts from both trials resulted in her canonization in 1920.\n",
      "Like all holy figures whose earthly existence separates them from the broad mass of humanity, a saint is a story, and Joan of Arc’s is like no other.\n",
      "The self-proclaimed agent of God’s will, she wasn’t immortalized so much as she entered the collective imagination as a living myth. Centuries after death, she has been embraced by Christians, feminists, French nationalists, Mexican revolutionaries and even hairdressers. (Her crude cut inspired the bob flappers wore as a symbol of independence from patriarchal strictures.) Her voices have been diagnosed retroactively as symptoms of schizophrenia, epilepsy, even tuberculosis. It seems Joan of Arc will never be laid to rest. Is this because stories we understand are stories we forget?\n",
      "Joan frustrates efforts to reduce her to mortal proportions. What can explain what her voices told her, whether directing her movements in battle or scripting answers to her inquisitors. And what about her reputed clairvoyance, accounts that her touch raised a child from the dead, her ability to direct the wind to fill her stalled boats’ sails?\n",
      "We don’t need narratives that rationalize human experience so much as those that enlarge it with the breath of mystery. For as long as we look to heroes for inspiration, to leaders whose vision lifts them above our limited perspective, who cherish their values above their earthly lives, the story of Joan of Arc will remain one we remember, and celebrate.\n",

      "There is absolutely no excuse for the New York Police Department’s decision to show a hate-filled film about Muslims to more than 1,400 city police officers.\n",
      "Relations between police and the diverse Muslim community are already tense after The Associated Press uncovered aggressive surveillance of Muslims, including American citizens. The propaganda of this film will only damage those relations further and make law enforcement more difficult.\n",
      "The film shows some of the grisliest jihadist terrorists attacks in recent years and argues that the real agenda for Islamists in America is to infiltrate and dominate the country. The department said at first that it was shown to only a handful of officers, but that proved to be false when the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University obtained police records through the courts after a nine-month struggle. Police documents show some confusion over where the film, “The Third Jihad,” came from — possibly a contractor — and how it kept running for three months to a year in a conference area.\n",
      "Paul Browne, a Police Department spokesman, said the officer responsible for making sure the film ran “on a continuous loop” while officers were filling out papers has been disciplined. That is not remotely enough.\n",
      "Mr. Browne said Commissioner Raymond Kelly found the film objectionable. Mr. Kelly should apologize for the film, which was financed and distributed by the conservative Clarion Fund, and he should make clear that his department does not tolerate such noxious and dangerous stereotyping.\n",

      "Andy Carey, an underappreciated cog in the powerful Yankees machine of the 1950s that won four consecutive American League pennants and two World Series, died on Dec. 15 at his home in Costa Mesa, Calif. He was 80.\n",
      "The cause was Lewy body dementia, his daughter Elizabeth Carey said.\n",
      "A third baseman, Carey was an above-average fielder — he once turned four double plays in a game — and a solid bottom-third-of-the-order hitter on teams that had sluggers like Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Bill Skowron, Elston Howard and Hank Bauer hitting ahead of him. He played eight seasons with the Yankees, from 1952 to 1959 (and four games in 1960, before he was traded), and was the regular third baseman for much of that time in a decade when New York City dominated the baseball world.\n",
      "In 1954, his best year as a hitter, he batted .302 in 122 games, with 65 runs batted in, as the Yankees won 103 games but finished second to the Cleveland Indians. The next year, Carey led the American League in triples with 11, and the Yankees began a string of four consecutive pennants. In 1956 and 1958, they won the World Series, each time exacting revenge — defeating first the Brooklyn Dodgers, who had beaten them in 1955, and then the Milwaukee Braves, who had triumphed over them in 1957.\n",
      "Carey played a key role in one of baseball’s landmark games. He twice helped preserve the only perfect World Series game, pitched by Don Larsen against the Dodgers on Oct. 8, 1956. In the second inning, the Dodgers’ Jackie Robinson smacked a shot between third and short that Carey knocked down, allowing Yankees shortstop Gil McDougald to pick up the ball and nip Robinson at first. In the eighth, he robbed Gil Hodges by snaring a low line drive that seemed headed for left field.\n",
      "Andy Carey was born Andrew Arthur Hexem in Oakland, Calif., on Oct. 18, 1931, and grew up in nearby Alameda. His parents divorced when he was very young, and his mother, Nola, married Kenneth Carey, a lawyer.\n",
      "He played baseball as a freshman at St. Mary’s College of California, and then played a summer of semiprofessional ball in Idaho. He was preparing to follow his stepfather into the law but left college when the Yankees offered him a $60,000 bonus, an eye-opening figure at the time. He played for Yankees farm teams in Kansas City Mo., and Syracuse, and when he was elevated to the big leagues in 1952, there was speculation that he would be converted to shortstop and eventually succeed Phil Rizzuto at that position. That did not happen, and by 1954, he was the Yankees’ regular third baseman.\n",
      "The emergence of Clete Boyer, who became the Yankees’ third baseman in the 1960s, eventually made Carey expendable, and he was sent to Kansas City (by then a big-league franchise). He also played for the Chicago White Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers before retiring in 1962. His career average, over 11 seasons, was .260, with 64 home runs and 350 R.B.I.\n",
      "Carey was married four times and divorced three. In addition to his daughter Elizabeth, he is survived by his wife, Susie; a sister, Sandy Carey; another daughter, Jennifer James; a son, Christopher; and three granddaughters.\n",

      "SEOUL, South Korea — A South Korean software magnate and university dean, whose presidential ambitions are among the biggest unknowns in this election year, said Monday that he would start a charity to help tackle widening social and economic inequality, a major grievance here.\n",
      "“I continue to reflect on what roles I can play for our society’s change for the better,” said the magnate, Ahn Cheol-soo. “Politics can be one of them.”\n",
      "Mr. Ahn, 49, made the announcement during his first news conference since fall, when his endorsement of a candidate for mayor in Seoul — pitched as an appeal to the spirit of participatory democracy — turned him into the country’s brightest political star.\n",
      "The founder and largest shareholder of South Korea’s most successful software company, AhnLab, he is also dean of Seoul National University’s Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology. Although he has not clarified whether he will run in the presidential election in December, surveys show him to be the favorite to win if he does. Every move and word from him — including an oblique comment about politics on Monday — can prompt a bout of speculation in the South Korean news media about his intentions.\n",
      "Mr. Ahn developed one of South Korea’s first antivirus computer programs and has distributed it to millions of South Koreans free of charge. In November, he announced that he would donate half of his 37 percent stake in his company to charity.\n",
      "The donated shares, which will go into the foundation he announced Monday, were valued at 218 billion won, or about $195 million. That makes him one of the most generous donors in South Korea, where business tycoons are often accused of breaking the law to channel wealth to their children and of making big charitable donations only when facing corruption scandals.\n",
      "In interviews and lectures at college campuses around the country in recent years, Mr. Ahn has exhilarated disgruntled young voters by criticizing the country’s big businesses, which he says do not do enough to create jobs, but instead stifle smaller entrepreneurs like “zoo animals.”\n",
      "The meteoric rise of Mr. Ahn, and the political discontent he represents, has sent the established political parties into a crisis mode. The governing and main opposition parties, desperate to create a fresh image before parliamentary elections in April, recently did what they often do in times of trouble: they changed their names. They are now the New World Party and the Democratic Unity Party, respectively.\n",
      "Both parties are also recruiting a legion of political outsiders to run in the April election.\n",
      "Because of their concentrated wealth and influence, family-owned conglomerates known as chaebol have become a key election issue. Daughters and granddaughters from chaebol families recently abandoned their bakery businesses after President Lee Myung-bak charged that their “pastime” of selling cakes and croissants deprived mom-and-pop bakers of their livelihoods.\n",
      "Conglomerates like Samsung and Hyundai have fueled South Korea’s booming export-oriented economy. But they have long been accused of using their power to check the growth of smaller companies and of keeping them under contracts that critics like Mr. Ahn have likened to slavery.\n",
      "Mr. Lee’s government has come under fire for business-friendly policies that have coincided with an expansion of chaebol influence. During his four years in office, the conglomerates have added more subsidiaries and expanded into sectors, like food and retail, usually occupied by smaller companies. Meanwhile, small and medium-size companies, which account for 90 percent of employment, have struggled and found it hard to add jobs.\n",
      "While acknowledging such problems, Mr. Lee has warned that populist pressure on the chaebol could harm the economy.\n",
      "“All the political environment is making businesses shrink, and this is not good for the people,” he said at a cabinet meeting last Tuesday, when the main opposition proposed more taxes and tougher regulations on chaebol.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — When Jack Valenti walked the halls of Congress, friends by the dozen gripped, grinned and took note of what was worrying the movie industry’s dapper chief lobbyist.\n",
      "Christopher J. Dodd now fills Mr. Valenti’s shoes. But he stays out of those halls, thanks to restrictions on his ability to lobby Congress until 2013.\n",

      "A major push by copyright holders — including those in the Motion Picture Association of America, of which Mr. Dodd is chairman — for a tough federal law to control foreign online piracy collapsed this week under stiff resistance from technology companies and their allies.\n",
      "On Wednesday, as Web sites expressed opposition to the legislation, important lawmakers withdrew their support, leaving Mr. Dodd and his associates scrambling to find what could be salvaged.\n",
      "In an interview Thursday, Mr. Dodd said he would welcome a summit meeting between Internet companies and content companies, perhaps convened by the White House, that could lead to a compromise. On Friday, Senator Harry Reid indefinitely postponed a cloture vote scheduled for Tuesday in the Senate, which appears to promise the death of the legislation in its current form.\n",
      "“The perfect place to do it is a block away from here,” said Mr. Dodd, who pointed from his office on I Street toward 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n",
      "But the startlingly speedy collapse of the antipiracy campaign by some of Washington’s savviest players — not just the motion picture association, but also the United States Chamber of Commerce and the Recording Industry Association of America — signaled deep changes in antipiracy lobbying in the future. By Mr. Dodd’s account, no Washington player can safely assume that a well-wired, heavily financed legislative program is safe from a sudden burst of Web-driven populism.\n",
      "“This is altogether a new effect,” Mr. Dodd said, comparing the online movement to the Arab Spring. He could not remember seeing “an effort that was moving with this degree of support change this dramatically” in the last four decades, he added.\n",
      "That shift was exposed this week partly because Mr. Dodd found himself in a political knife fight while being forced to sheathe his most powerful weapon: 36 years of personal relationships with a Congress in which he had served as a representative and then senator since 1975, before joining the motion picture association last March.\n",
      "Under legislation passed in 2007, Mr. Dodd is barred from personally lobbying Congress for two years after leaving office. Hired as the consummate Washington insider to carry the film industry’s banner on crucial issues like piracy, Mr. Dodd ended up being more coach than player. He helped devise a strategy that called for his coalition to line up a strong array of legislative sponsors and supporters behind two similar laws — the Stop Online Piracy Act in the House, and the Protect I.P. Act in the Senate — and then to move them through the Congress quickly before possible opposition from tech companies could coalesce.\n",
      "But slow pacing gave the Internet and free speech advocates time to wake up and mobilize, turning what might have been a relatively simple exercise for Mr. Dodd and his allies into a bitter struggle. The delays violated a cardinal rule among professional lobbyists, who generally believe the worst enemy of a proposed law is the legislative clock.\n",
      "Mr. Dodd said that the entire industry was surprised by the intensity of the objections that arose in the last couple of weeks. “This was a whole new different game all of a sudden,” he said. “This thing was considered by many to be a slam dunk.”\n",
      "Data shows that copyright holders and supporters of the bills outspent opponents substantially in the early stages of the debate. But by many accounts the tech industry has stepped up its lobbying efforts in recent weeks. New spending reports expected shortly indicate whether the balance has shifted.\n",
      "The Senate vote on Tuesday will show whether opponents like Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, have succeeded in derailing that chamber’s version of the law.\n",
